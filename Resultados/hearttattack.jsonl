{"user_name": ["hearttattack", "callmepersephoni"], "user_comment": "Because I am partly on Eating-Disorder-Tumblr and I can’t make everyone recover; here are some tips from a witch that is struggling with bulimic anorexia for anyone who might struggle with any purging-type ED: \n Do not brush your teeth after purging, same goes for after eating, because this may brush acid into your teeth.\n Use mouth wash instead \n Also use a tongue cleaner \n And when brushing your teeth use sensitive \n dental floss\n  \n Eat cashews, they help with caries, chew really well\n When you have already damaged your sphincter and/or developed a gastritis go to the doctor. Get yourself some meds. \n If\n  \n you can’t afford going to the doctor identify your triggers (i live in germany we have a health care system but idk where y’all are live) \n Take electrolytes, isotonic sport drinks also work, when you purge your electrolytes won’t be intact which can lead to real heart damage and electrolytes will prevent dizziness, low heart rates etc. \n Also try to get some sugar in your system after purging, i can’t get a real answer through research but somehow my insulin goes down after to the point I fainted to many times.\n But please don’t eat like for half an hour after purging (your stomach lining is irritated so if you eat that could easily lead to purging again which kind of makes everyone of us upset or if you don’t have a gastritis you trigger the development) \n When you purge something that looks like strawberry jam or coffee ground, go to the hospital immediately. That is a sign of internal bleeding and that may need a) strong medication or with high probability b) an operation\n If you know that you damaged your organs, try to be aware of the fact that you need to eat more for a certain time and move less while sleeping more because you body needs to heal \n (more about that at the end) \n KNOW YOUR TRIGGERS \n Which\n  foods (may) trigger my mental purging urge? \n Which circumstances trigger my mental purging urge? (A certain time, a certain stress level, a certain sound/person/discussion whatever. Know your triggers. Write them down. And be aware of them.\n  (For example my fear foods are triggers, but also when I am stressed, have experienced rejection, my parents arguing, my sister bringing home food for me, and I know that at like 11pm my binging urge gets strong because this is when I ate when I tried to recover because my parents were asleep and they couldn’t judge me for eating because they were used to me not eating or worried because sometimes I managed to purge every meal I have eaten, so sometimes when I didn’t eat anything and would eat a twix that lead to purging but also when I ate normally and felt slightly too full this lead to purging, know when u are ALMOST satisfied if feeling full triggers you, it triggers me) \n Which foods (may) trigger my physical purging urge? \n (When u can’t hold food in) Like I have said this is only for those who may developed a gastritis or reflux due to sphincter-damage. \n Things that are usually triggering are caffeine, sparkling water or soft drinks, too much water at once, and eating after drinking too much, high-fat products, for me dairy was a huge problem, fish, meat high-acid fruit such as orange or lemon and much more.\n  I have a list for myself but it is important for you to know your trigger foods of both mentally and physically dependent purging-urge and THEN identify your limit because developing new fear foods because of my gastritis and sphincter-damage made everything pretty much worse. You can eat those things but u need to have some sort of moderation. (F.ex. Many of my actual safe foods triggered my reflux well and then I was left with almost nothing to eat which stressed me the fuck out which again made my bpd much worse than it could have been)\n Okay, these ones are more like a witchy/spiritual tips, but oh my dear Hecate i swear they work and make everything SO MUCH EASIER:\n Take healing earth capsules. In Germany you can get them at every drug store. Idk if it is the placebo or if they really work but it lessens your symptoms of post-purge damage. \n Drink tea. Fennel, Lavender, Chamomile, nettle ginger and many more herbs help with stomach issues but drink whatever you like, also each herb has a personal meaning for me in my practice, use that as placebo. For example you can see lavender as herb to help you with self acceptance, calmness, self forgiveness and/or overall health. But you need to find your own meaning and embrace it :) \n LISTEN TO HEALING FREQUENCIES WHILE LAYING DOWN ON YOUR BED. CLOSE YOUR EYES. LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR STOMACH/AND OR GENERAL DIGESTIVE TRACT AND IMAGINE HOW A HEALING LIGHT IS COMING FROM YOUR HANDS. IMAGINE HOW YOUR CELLS ARE NEW FORMING AND HEALING, IMAGINE AND FEEL WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE HEALTHY. IMAGINE WHAT YOU WANT TO FEEL LIKE BE PRECISELY. DO THIS EVERY DAY FOR AT LEAST 10 DAYS. I SWEAR THIS WORKS IT IS MAGICAL. \n Manifest that you stop purging. Manifest that shit. Write things down that you are looking forward to when you stopped purging. Track your progress, tell people (or literally anything) about it that you know could be proud of you. Speak it out loud. You don’t have anyone to talk to? Fine. Write a post even though nobody reads it. Talk to your stuffed animals “I didn’t purge today, I am proud of me, when I stop purging I can eat normally again and dance because i don’t feel too nauseous to do what I love”, create an environment that helps you with that, have a person you look up to be like.

{"user_name": ["hearttattack", "tropicalfield"], "user_comment": "Harm Reduction Eating Disorder-Edition\n The following post might be triggering, altough not intended.\n \nThis list is a collection of my own tips, tips I found on tumblr and tips my doctors and therapists told me:\n Always carry something with actual sugar in it with you. No, not a zero sugar candy but something with glucose. Take it if you feel dizzy/ feel like you are about to pass out.\n Eat if you want to drive/ride! Doesn’t matter if you wanna go somewhere by car or by bicycle. You are putting yourself and others at risk!\nDon’t. Do. It. If you don’t wanna break your fast ask someone else to get you there or take the bus. If you really need to get there by your own you should eat s o m e t h i n g. Maybe your safe food or some fruit.\n Don’t trust people that claim to be a coach! Someone who suffers from an eating disorder would never share tips to destroy yourself! Most of them are old man that try to get your nudes. Never ever send them pictures or give them personal information. If you need to vent or you need something just text me and I will listen.\n You don’t need to restrict like crazy in order to lose weight. Check out your basal metabolic rate. This is the amount of calories your body burns by simply existing, like laying in bed all day and not moving an inch. You should not eat less than your basal metabolic rate. \n If you are a minor, don’t tell anyone. Don’t put your age in your description. There are creepy people out here that are looking out for young girls that way.\n I know going to the toilet can be a tough situation when you suffer from an eating disorder. Instead of using laxatives try out natural apple-juice or plum-juice, maybe even some dry fruits. You can also try out flaxseeds (drink water with it!) or maybe you want to take some magnesium.\n You should take vitamins/ go to the doctor to check your vitamin levels.\n That one is well known, but I want to mention that you shouldn’t brush your teeth after purging. Drink water or milk and wait 30-60 minutes before you brush your teeth. If you struggle with bulimia you should also invest into a good toothpaste and go to the dentist on a regular basis.\n Don’t count calories when you binge. You will only make yourself feel bad by doing that. It is not helping you at all. Drink water or tea and lay down. If your tummy hurts you should put a pillow or something like that underneath your legs. This position will help your belly to relax.\n Don’t go ‘all or nothing’. If you binged take some time to rest until you get better. Don’t go in even harder, because you think your day is already ruined. Don’t eat another bag of potato chips because “it doesn’t matter anymore and you already fucked up”. The brain is like a field. Everytime you binge you are leaving a trail. The more often you use this trail, the more wide beaten it will become. If you stop using the trail, grass will overgrow this path and it will be easier to make new, healthy habits. One day you will not even be able to tell where the path was.\nWith that said, every single time you refuse to binge, you refuse to give in because “you already messed up” it will get easier to resist the next time you feel the cravings kick in.", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/hearttattack/707074822121930752/harm-reduction-eating-disorder-edition"}

They NEED to know this information in order to treat you. If you have to stay for a prolonged period of time (overnight or longer), they need to know this so they can KEEP YOU FROM BECOMING SERIOUSLY ILL/DYING FROM WITHDRAWAL EFFECTS. They also need to make sure they don’t give you a medication that will make you sick/possibly kill you if combined with drugs/alcohol. \n ER WORKERS WILL NOT REPORT YOU TO THE POLICE FOR HAVING ILLEGAL DRUGS IN YOUR SYSTEM. They’re asking this information so that they can make whatever’s going on with you better without making it worse first. Medications that cannot be taken with alcohol or certain drugs can kill you if you don’t tell the ER staff that you’ve had alcohol/done drugs. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TURN YOU IN. THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO TREAT YOU/SAVE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT ACCIDENTALLY KILLING YOU BC THEY DIDNT KNOW YOU HAVE DRUGS IN YOUR SYSTEM.\n Thank you for coming to my Ted talk\n @maybefandomstuff\n  mentioned Good Samaritan laws in the tags and I forgot about those:\n “Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or whom they believe to be injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated”\n You’ll have to look up the laws in your area, but if your area has Good Samaritan laws, you won’t be arrested for calling 911 for your friend who’s ODed on an illegal substance or for underage drinking if you call 911 for your underage friend with alcohol poisoning. A lot of colleges have Good Samaritan clauses in their handbooks as well\n Also, if EMTs or paramedics or ER/A&E docs don’t know that you’re ODing or have alcohol poisoning, they’re gonna waste time running tests trying to figure out what’s wrong with you. Not only can that cost you thousands of dollars, but it can also kill you depending on how much time they spend running tests.\n TL;DR: \n Tell your EMT/ER doc that you’ve taken drugs or had alcohol. You won’t get in legal trouble. Not telling them can and possibly will kill you.", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/hearttattack/705037055229657088"}

You may wonder how? With anorexia you can die even if your bmi says your overweight because of the fact malnutrition can happen at any weight for example on the show my 600lb life a man at 430 was hospitalized for starving himself and getting malnourished he almost died! With bullimia it's not necessarily you die from being underweight it's from your body giving out all that acid you throw up messes with your kidneys your liver etc your body starts shutting down so does your stomach because it's not meant to throw up that much as someone who's been hospitalized due to bullimia.\n Don't wait Til your \"skinny enough\" to get help when only 20% of people with eds are underweight.\n Please reblog this it could save someone's life\n Edit: don't forget about BED normally when people think of EDs they think bone skinny people when in reality many countries like American and England BED is becoming more of a issue as well ", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/hearttattack/704805618238783488"}
