They can't. They know too much, have lived and suffered too much. They find themselves becoming precisely the patronizing parent figure that annoyed them away from their previous forum home. Suddenly, they are surrounded by literal 13 year olds who, in some cases, haven't even learned about the hazard of laxatives, purging or diuretics yet. And they are having these dangerous discussions on a board browsed by impressionable 12 year olds. There is no 25 year old ED sufferer who can bear witness these things and not be appalled. Even if they themselves did exactly the same thing a decade ago. If they don't find themselves forced into the role of \"forum parent\", they feel like a fucking alien, an outsider. Their metabolism is shot from years of starvation, they can't keep up with the weight loss speed of these new kids, nor can they pretend they are indestructible any longer.\n And \n these kids are still in school. Still on track for the perfect life. While these older, displaced members are now struggling through their soul-crushing part time retail job, the only thing they can handle. Then coming home and staring blankly at Netflix while spitting up whole bags of candy, until they face puffs up and their jaws ache and this has been their life for a decade now. The cultural divide is too much. It the end, they leave kids to be kids. The quest remains unsuccessful, for what they truly missed was not ED memes or drama, it was their own youth. Their own naivity, the days when they felt indestructible. When they weren't burdened with adult expectations or fear that this could be their life forever. When you're only 16 or 18, you feel the potential ahead of you. The ability to have any kind of future you'd like. Even if you're pretty convinced you're going to die before you're 20, you know the potential is there. And somewhere, in your heart of hearts, deep beneath the darkness and cynicism you believe that one day you will be loved. Maybe married, maybe produce kids, maybe find your purpose and have a beautiful career and a beautiful life. And your ED would just be a brooding part of the past. But once those youths reach their mid-20s, for those who are still sick, the illusion becomes just that.

(this is a personal problem but still)\n -actually being happy to be at a NORMAL weight for once. \n -”MY BMI IS FINALLY UNDER 25!”\n -lower chances of actually hitting your ugw because your body literally can’t lose more.\n -LOOSE SKIN. L O T S OF IT. \n -knowing you’ve lost more than most of the fellow anas, but not being able to talk about it because your cw isn’t low enough just yet.\n so shoutout to all the bigger people with anorexic tendencies, because they deserve way more. because they’ve gone through this pain for so long without enough recognition. because within the ana community, they’re often not even acknowledged. because THEY ARE VALID TOO. \n i started at over 250lbs and hit my first plateau at 149, so i do have a right to complain, thank you very much.

Could be the meal that you're craving, fast food or just whatever you want to cook, doesn't matter as long as it's a balanced meal, and the least amount of carbs the better (because insulin and blood sugar mumbo jumbo, but that's not very necessary right now). Preferably with a liquid. Make it juice, tea or a smoothie. Try to stay away from soda for this.\n Now here's the really fucking tough part:\n Eat it slowly. As slow as you can. And when you're done, wait ten minutes. I know those ten minutes would be really fucking painful because your brain is screaming at you to just raid your whole kitchen and eat three rotisserie chickens, five mega every topping pizzas and quite possibly a whole horse, but after those ten minutes, the urge will lessen.

Updated Edition\n WHAT ARE WE DOING?\n Fill out the survey on the original Post Plus post (be polite, don’t spam, but GET YOUR POINT ACROSS that we don’t want this). Since we mean business, it’s time to hit them where it hurts; Ad Revenue.\n We’re proposing a 24 hour log off as the main event of phase one.\n WHEN IS THE PROTEST?\n The protest starts by logging off on August 6th, 2021 at 12am Eastern Time (US). Here’s a quick chart to help figure out when you log out.\nAUGUST 6th, 2021\n 12 am Eastern Time (US)\n   4 am UTC\n   5 am BST/London\n   6 am Central Europe Time\n   7 am Moscow Standard Time\n   9:30 am Indian Standard Time\n   12 Noon Hong Kong Time/Australian Western Time\n   1 pm Japan Standard Time\n   1:30 pm Australian Central Time\n   2 pm Australian Eastern Time\n AUGUST 5th, 2021\n   11 pm Central Time (US)\n  10 pm Mountain Time (US)\n    9 pm Pacific Time (US)\n THE END TIME IS 24 HOURS FROM THE START TIME!\n So that means if you log off at say, 6 am Central Europe Time you’ll log back in at 6 am Central Europe Time on August 7th. We’d prefer if if there is no posting, no queues, no likes, and no reblogs during this period. \n WHAT IF I CAN’T/WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?\n Like this post, share it, and use the hashtags #tumblrlogoff2021 and/or #postplusprotest on ANY and ALL social media. If you’re using the mobile version, you can always leave an honest review on the app center of your choice (once again: be polite, don’t spam, but GET YOUR POINT ACROSS!).\n WHY IS POST PLUS/POST+ SO BAD?\n Tumblr’s primary focus is on FAN content (whether any of us want to admit it or not). Putting these kinds of contents behind patreon like paywalls is a terrible idea and the legality is NOT in the user or their subscribers favor. You can absolutely get in legal trouble for what tumblr is proposing with this new feature. There’s also the worry about the site’s (poor) security and access to Post Plus users bank information. Do you really want a site that lacks a functioning search function and whose userbase routinely get hacked to have your credit card information? No, you really don’t. \n WILL THIS WORK?\n Maybe, maybe not.

How do you comfort yourself after a binge?\n I dont deal with binges tbh, but when I eat a meal that I feel is too big I usually end up purging. I hate purging (it's super bad for you and I damaged my teeth by doing it in the past) so that alone keeps me from going overboard. \n 21. Something you want to tell about your ED but have never had the chance \n Idk if this really qualifies but whatever. I have a special needs sister who is extremely thin, she's not unhealthy but her bone structure is tiny and she has a hard time building any muscle tone. When I was still living at home and dealing with my eating disorder, I always saw these pictures of girls that were able to wrap their fingers around their bicep and I always hated myself for not being anywhere near that thin. So one day out of curiosity, I put my hand on my sisters arm and realized that my fingers didn't go all the way around her arm either. She was tiny, like 10 years old and 60-something pounds and my fingers didn't reach. It was a real wakeup call. I hadn't realized until then how extremely unhealthy my mindset had gotten. \n 38.  Dumbest weight loss advice you've ever gotten\n Back when I was young and naive someone told me that holding your pee made you burn more calories. Of course I tried it.

Obviously, Post+ is a terrible idea that is trying to bank revenue on user content. Unlike patreon or onlyfans, tumblr’s primary focus is on FAN content. The legality of this is NOT in the users favor and as the new tumblr TOS states, said users will be entirely liable for whatever legal matters arise.\n SO WHAT ARE WE DOING?\n Besides filling out the survey, it’s time to show tumblr we mean business and show our displeasure by hitting them where it hurts.\n Ad revenue.\n We’re proposing a 24 hour log off as phase one of this protest. \n WHEN IS THE PROTEST? \n August 6th 2021\n 12 am Eastern Time (US)\n 4am UTC\n 5am BST/London\n 6am Central Europe Time\n 7am Moscow Standard Time\n 9:30 Indian Standard Time\n 12 noon Hong Kong Time/Australian Western\n 1:00 pm Japan Standard Time\n 1:30 pm Australian Cental time\n 2:00 pm Australian Eastern Time\n August 5th 2021\n 11pm Central Time (US)\n 10pm  Mountain Time (US)\n 9pm Pacific Time (US)\n THE END TIME IS 24 HOURS FROM START TIME!!!\n So no posting, no queues, no likes, and no reblogs!\n WHAT IF I CAN’T/WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?\n Like this post and share it AS MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE.

What is your earliest ED related memory?\n I distinctly remember getting that first little bit of fat on my belly when I hit puberty, I'd always been really athletic as a kid and it freaked me out and I thought I was getting fat. I'd pinch it constantly and would always look to see if it was visible in mirrors. \n 4. Favorite safe meal? \n I have a bagel thin with whipped cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers like 5 nights a week. It's less than 200cal and tastes amazing. It was one of my fav foods before relapsing, so to be able to make a safe version of it is awesome. \n 40. How do you handle ED related nausea, fatigue, sickness, or weakness?\n Slowly drinking liquids usually helps me with nausea/sickness, ginger tea is great if it's really bad. The fatigue/weakness I can basically tune out at this point, or if it's really bad I'll use self talk to push through. \n Thank you for asking ❤", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/gimme-my-bones/658701407207276544/2-4-and-40"}

My longest period of \"recovery\" was 5 years, but during that time I was homeless and had a tumor that made it super hard to eat so I was super underweight without having any eating disorder symptoms. \n 17. Do you smoke? \n I smoked cigarettes for nearly 10 years and quit last year, I still vape tho. Was going to try to quit that this year but since I relapsed I dont think I'll be able to. \n 19. Diet soda or energy drinks\n I drink both daily lol. Celsius is my wake up drink and I drink Zevia the rest of the time.

If I'm super depressed I'll basically stay in bed and watch cartoons all day, or watch a movie with my bf unless I'm feeling like I want to be alone. I take 5htp if it goes on for more than a day. Ed bad days I chug tea and diet soda nonstop and exercise til I can barely walk. Anxiety/ptsd bad days I take kratom and spend time outside and make sure im not left alone with my thoughts. \n 9. When did you realize you had an ED?\n When I was like 14, a few years after I started struggling with food. I had a friend who also had an eating disorder (diagnosed) and realized we did a lot of the same things. It was good to feel understood but also was super toxic because of how competitive eating disorders are. \n 16.
