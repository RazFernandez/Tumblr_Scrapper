Nobody ever acknowledges the tremendous sacrifice suicidal people make every time we choose not to kill ourselves. When a person who is suffering so horribly that death seems like their best option decides not to take their one way out, and to instead remain in hell, day after day, month after month, year after year, because they don‚Äôt want to hurt the people they love, they are doing something extraordinary. Not killing yourself when it‚Äôs all you want to do is the purest act of love I can imagine. Dying for someone is easy - you don‚Äôt have to deal with any of the consequences, you have your moment of nobility and then it‚Äôs all over. But living for someone, when the simple fact of consciousness is literal torture for you? Every single suicidal person who ever made a choice to not kill themselves in a moment of misery is a goddamn hero in my eyes.

Neopronouns users were so based for doing this. \n A classmate in undergrad once tried to test me by claiming she would only agree to respect nonbinary pronouns if I used Her Majesty as pronouns for her.\n She lasted 2 days before she realized I had absolutely zero problem doing exactly that and was too embarrassed to ever argue with me about pronouns in class again.\n When I was working at the greenhouse, one of my coworkers was getting flustered because he was a Proper Gentleman who called everyone \"Sir\" or \"Ma'am\" and was getting genuinely heated that there wasn't a gender-neutral honorific for nonbinary people like me. \n \"Well, you could always call me 'Your Majesty'.\" I said. \n As a Joke.\n Because in addition to looking and sounding like an older Yosemitie Sam, he took me \n Extremely Seriously\n  and addressed me as \"Your Majesty\" for the rest of the summer. Which was hysterical because it was things like \"Your Majesty? Where is the fungicide?\" and *gestures at me* \"You'll have to as Their Majesty about the tomatoes.\"  He also would call every single person he could not immediately identify the gender of \"Your Majesty\" and also everyone that had neon hair. \n So yes, you should absolutely rigorously adhere to someone's pronouns (Especially if they're unusual pronouns), because it's respectful, because it's clowning on assholes, and because it is fucking delightful.
