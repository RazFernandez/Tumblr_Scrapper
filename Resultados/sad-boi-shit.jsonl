Buy two).\n Light shearing nicks heal fast because the sheep’s waxy lanolin coats their skin. Though most sheep farmers won’t Nick the sheep bc it gets blood on the wool. \n Sheep farmers MUST treat their sheep with care, because any little thing that upsets sheep affects the quality of their wool. \n Even “natural” fibers like bamboo take TONS of water to process and alkaline dyes to color them. You can dye wool with unsweetened koolaid. \n People have been raising sheep for close to 10,000 years. And all that time, we’ve been breeding them for better wool. Most mammals with thick coats shed naturally in the spring, sheep don’t because we bred it out of them.\n Sheep and their farmers have an actual symbiotic relationship. Farmers remove their excess wool, keeping them healthy, and then sell that wool to buy what they need.\n it’s also naturally antimicrobial and resists odors (unlike polyester, which absorbs them better and makes it harder to wash them out).", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/sad-boi-shit/704404925428482048/as-far-as-ethical-materials-go-you-cant-really"}
