{"user_name": ["ascaryghost", "elierlick"], "user_comment": "In 1934-1936, trans brothers Mark and David Ferrow of Yarmouth, UK, both transitioned at age 13 with full parental support. Mark medically transitioned first in 1939 at 17 and his brother soon followed. “Though we have been girls, we have both felt men at heart,” Mark told a reporter. Their stories show that trans youth can grow up to be happy, celebrated adults.\n David lived in their hometown of Great Yarmouth, UK for the rest of his life. He became a local icon. At 15, he started selling books. He later ran a wildly successful bookshop until death in 2006, age 81, 68 years after transitioning. He had a daughter, Jan, who supported his work. The whole town adored him. Why, yes, that is a mug of his face.\n\nMark, always passionate about art, joined the Kirby Muxlue Players troupe as a writer and traveled throughout the UK. His David Gower painting is currently in the UK’s National Portrait Gallery! His art still hangs in collections all over the country - although it’s almost never recognized as being by a trans artist. Mark married Edna Hall in 1942 and died in 1991, age 68, in Leicester.\n\nIt’s important to mention that it’s unclear if both men are intersex despite the reports. At the time, it was customary for non-intersex trans people to claim intersex conditions in order to access care (e.g. Roberta Cowell). Regardless if they were trans or intersex and trans, I would hate their underreported stories to be forgotten!", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/ascaryghost/683577123403939840/elierlick-in-1934-1936-trans-brothers-mark-and"}

On the other hand, some cis women have a BMI ~ 22 and still have a thigh gap because their adult bone structure is different. \n Everybody has different genetics and circumstances.  You cannot ever make your body look like someone else’s, and you cannot control how your body changes over time. We all grow, and one day we’re all going to get old. It’s so incredibly useless to waste your life agonising over how your body compares to other peoples bodies, or your past or future body. Some people are going to gain and other people are going to loose and it’s all reversible and changeable and subjective. \n Try to set your priorities straight and get on with your life: Do something you’ve always dreamed of that would make your childhood self smile, show yourself the respect you deserve, let your compassion flow out to others.

Other oral symptoms of eating disorders include mouth sores, cracked or dry lips, bleeding gums, chronic dry mouth, enlarged salivary glands, and bad breath.”  \n love that for me\n so apprently the only way to fix it is putting oil in ur mouth\n so yea i’m oiling my mf teeth rn\n Hmmm, my mum’s been holding oil in her mouth for a while and apparently it was helping with something and then we talked about something and she stopped using oil (it got expensive, it was squalene or something) and started just holding saliva in her mouth instead and apparently it works the same and she got an idea because i always hold saliva in my mouth.\n An idea to not dry out your hums with frequent brushing/mouthwash\n And also that awful coating-feeling after coke… \n Chewing gum or eating hard candies made with xylitol may also help! It’s good for oral health and can help with a lot of those problems. My uncle has a lot of the above symptoms (not due to ED, he had throat cancer and the radiation treatment fucked up his mouth) and xylitol helps treat the oral side effects of radiation and keep them from getting worse. \n I personally use the brand Spry (Xlear) but there are lots of options. Just make sure you keep it away from pets as it’s highly toxic to them.\n honestly the more i read about ed symptoms the more i realize how grave they are. like when i was 12 i was like ok LOL fucked up bones??? eat my ASS IDC. but like the older i get the more i realize that like this is my forever body and i have to take care of it. please people do everything u can w harm reduction it’s so fucking important. thank you both for all the tips.\n though bau, my mouth is dry due to medication so i don’t rly think i can do the saliva thing but it’s still useful to know💗", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/ascaryghost/679288256780779520/baugloophows-ascaryghost-ascaryghost"}

{"user_name": ["ascaryghost", "tiktoks-for-tired-tots", "amindamazed"], "user_comment": "transcript of video by TikTok account thatannamarie from early December 2021\n -begin transcript\n Here's a word that every queer person should know: homonationalism is not the name of my new synth-pop album. It's a concept from sociology that acknowledges how queer people are used in conversations about global politics. \n Homonationalism is when we use LGBT rights as a yardstick to judge how \"moral\" a society is. It's short for \"homonormative nationalism\"—say that five times fast—and it was first coined by Jasbir Puar to describe how the US presented itself as LGBT-friendly to contrast itself to \"homophobic\" Muslims during the War on Terror. It can also be applied to other contexts, like the way we talk about homophobic countries in Africa or the Caribbean while ignoring the role of European colonialism in those regions. \n Put a finger down if you've ever heard something like:\n You know being gay is a crime in Ghana, right?\n Those Middle Eastern countries are so backwards. Do you know what they do to gay people over there?\n Oh it's so weird. [Looks around as if hearing something from outside the room.] My neighbor's dog is going crazy...\n You know you've lost the plot when you're talking about homophobia among Muslims, when white American Christians are the ones who made gay marriage illegal, ignored the entire AIDS crisis, and to this day don't have any national policies regarding conversion therapy, a trans-panic defense, or the forcing of trans women into men's prisons and vice-versa.\n Barbados just became free of British rule this week; we should not be shocked if they have some homophobic policies.\n And while I obviously believe that a more moral society is one with robust protections for queer people, LGBT rights can't be used to judge other countries, to make us feel better about bombing them.\n As an aside, I live in Connecticut, an American state where it gets dark at 4pm now, and where LGBT rights are actually pretty good. We were one of the first states to institute gay marriage, transgender health care is part of our state insurance, and we're just generally more legally protected here. \n And yet while legal support is very robust in our state, there's very little cultural support. Homophobia and transphobia in day-to-day life is roughly as bad as any other part of the country, and we have no gay cultural infrastructure. Only enough gay bars to count on one hand, and no known queer meeting spaces otherwise. It's obviously not as bad as living in a place where being gay is a crime, but it's still pretty lonely out here.\n So for a variety of reasons, I don't appreciate queer and trans people being used as a pawn to further Islamophobia, anti-African sentiment, and general xenophobia. Mainly because it's racist and ignorant; many of these countries have a long, rich history of queer and trans and nonbinary identities before white European colonizers showed up, but also because western \"acceptance\" of LGBTQ people is very conditional and very limited in terms of material and legal protection. \n White supremacy wins when we pit queer people and people of color against each other. We need international solidarity and an acknowledgment of colonialism to achieve equality and equity.\n -end transcript", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/ascaryghost/677992738125398016"}

She stations herself in the plaza and likes to share news about the farms and villages she’s visited this week (at the moment we get a lot of baby animal news, like new calf announcements.) She has the unfortunate habit of denigrating her own cheeses without meaning to because she is a cheese perfectionist. You ask for a bleu, she grimaces hesitantly and says “Ah, poor choice, it doesn’t look quite right to me today”; or you tell her “I really liked the brie I picked last time, so creamy!” and she shakes her head and goes “Ah, you got lucky, often that farmer gives me such shitty brie with a chaulky texture—” then she suddenly looks frustrated with herself, you can tell she’s thinking “why am I giving this information to a client?? I’m the worst cheese saleswoman ever.” It’s very endearing. \n She also sells eggs, and always writes the name of the farmer she got it from on each carton so you can make sure to buy your friends’ eggs and avoid your enemies’ eggs. You’ve got to be like “Six Gilbert eggs please” and publicly announce where your loyalty lies, it’s a whole Thing. If one day you decide to go rogue and ask for Agnès eggs instead you can be sure people will notice, and they will talk. Getting my own chickens is the only way I have found to avoid pledging egg allegiance.\n I am OBSESSED with this egg based clique culture\n Some things are just \n extremely\n  French\n Gotta say that “…the mayor [finds] it mortifying that our village is too small to support its own cheese shop…” is The Most French sentiment I have ever heard in my life.", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/ascaryghost/677801646660665344/shrewreadings-elodieunderglass-hotsolvent"}

So here are some things I would recommend if you want to avoid max damage when you can't control yourself. \n Stopping at any point in a b/p cycle is better than just giving in. For me, compulsive purging makes me feel like shit and focusing on this can help me avoid continuing to binge after. But if you can stop mid binge, mid purge, AT ANY POINT, please walk away, we want to do as little damage as possible. \n If you just took your meds, its not worth it. Please try not to accidently throw up half of your intended dose of medication. \n Keep pedialyte or electrolyte water to drink after to help you avoid dehydration. Electrolyte imbalance from purging can have VERY negative effects on your heart and blood pressure. \n Tea with lemon n' honey! Pedialyte to keep your heart steady, but what about your throat? That shit hurts too, and a nice herbal tea with lemon n' honey can help sooth the damage caused by the forcefulness of purging. \n Tums are great if you get acid reflux from purging. \n Back when I was younger, people would say to drink and purge water after to \"make sure you get it all out.\" \n this is bullshit and dangerous. \n It will only make you more dehydrated and any potential heart arrhythmia will happen sooner than if you didn't. \n Avoid acidic food, and DO NOT brush your teeth immediately after, rather rinse your mouth with baking soda n' water instead. Wait an hour to brush your teeth, they won't rot as fast... \n Don't eat red/black/brown things while binging if you can avoid it and you know you can't stop yourself. You want to know if you are actually throwing up blood or not. \n Avoid sharp or hard/dense things. If it hurts coming up, it has a better chance of fucking up your throat. (I learned this lesson with fucking salt water taffy, as weird as it sounds, my point is be careful) \n Keep your nails short, and for fucks sake don't use silverware or toothbrushes. You want more sensory perception than less just in case of emergency. You can't feel the damage a spoon does, but your fingers sure as hell can. \n If your vomit looks like coffee grounds, but you didn't eat anything that dark, GO TO THE FUCKING HOSPITAL, you are likely bleeding internally and that is incredibly dangerous.\n If your poops look black and tar like, you might also be bleeding internally, its just coming out the other end, and again you probably need to go to a hospital. (Both this and #11 are symptoms of boerhaave syndrome which is a life threatening esophageal tear)\n And again, if you are coughing up anything red/pink/brown/black, this is possibly blood. You may wanna GO TO THE FUCKING HOSPITAL.\n Let's talk chest pain. There is a chace this can also be a symptom of boerhaave syndrome, but that is usually coupled with blood coming out somewhere. If there is no blood, but hella chest pain? This could be strain on your chest wall muscles from how forceful purging can be. I know if you're dealing with this it hurts very badly, but I promise taking slow breaths helps reacclamate your muscles after that trauma. Start at the edge of the discomfort and over about a day try to take deeper and deeper breaths, but try not to over do it. You don't want to over exert the already stressed muscles, that can actually put more strain on them and slow their healing. \n Purging puts a lot of stress on your body. Try to lay down and take it easy for a bit. Catch your breath, your body deserves a moment of rest. \n If you've been living with this for a while, please don't be afraid to ask a doctor to take an ekg of your heart and check on some of your organs. Regularly forcing your body to purge is so fucking physically traumatic, and we really ought to be kinder to our bodies. \n Special note for trans guys: \n TAKE OFF YOUR FUCKING BINDER BEFORE YOU PURGE YOU DUMB MOTHER FUCKERS. I KNOW DYSPHORIA SUCKS, BUT HOW THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT CHEST WALL PAIN? ITS FROM PURGING IN A BINDER REGULARLY AND THAT IS SO FUCKING BAD FOR YOU. JUST TAKE IT OFF FOR A BIT.  \n [I'm sorry for yelling but seriously guys]\n [EDIT: \n @b0neyst0ner\n  pointed this out and I want to mention it. If you purge too much you can wreck your gag reflex and make it harder to purge because the stimulation is no longer enough. But on the polar opposite end of this, you can weaken your gag reflex to the point of \"involuntary food rejection\" aka you spit up on yourself like a literal fucking infant. I get that one and its ridiculously embarrassing. If either of these things happen, do your best to take as long a break as you can from it. You body needs a break.

THE MOST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WAS LIKE 5-10% ARE YOU KIDDING \n Nope it's 100% true \n I-\n assuming this rule is american?\n but ok say pickles are 5kcal per 100g. 5x1.2= 6. max 6 calories FOR 100G thats still really good.\n as for other things it doesnt really matter bc in reality u dont burn the same amount of calories every day like sometimes ur body is doing stuff yk? so say u eat something with 40 calories more and 70 calories less one day or another in the end its not gonna make a difference. don’t worry and stay safe<33", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/ascaryghost/674820226442985472/assuming-this-rule-is-american-but-ok-say-pickles"}

But i stopped. I wasn’t in shape for sprinting, only distance, and i hadn’t warmed up properly which i need for my asthma. My chest was hurting. At least i did half. I had to sit down on a bench at the side of the road. I googled “signs of a silent heart attack”, realized i had none of the symptoms and walked home thinking about mortality, suddenly aware of how mortal i was. For a moment i thought i should up my intake, but then meh. I got home, now my hands were shaking and my balance was poor. I ate half a marshmallow and felt better. I’m addicted. It’s so much more than a mental illness like depression.

They kind of over-explained “Oh, she just showed up to say hi” and there was a vague nervousness in the air that even my autistic ass was picking up on.  Her friend was playing conspicuously with her phone.    I went “Ah, the safety.  Need to get a picture?”\n Dead silence for about a second and a half, then the friend took a picture, looked at my date, and said “Have fun” and walked out the door.  \n (I would ordinarily have been clueless, but I’d just been asked to be the safety the previous night.)\n My advice to male-presenting folks:  recognize that this not \n your\n  problem.  By which I mean, this sort of security check isn’t a problem for you.  It doesn’t hurt you.  You aren’t being insulted or disrespected.  And if you treat it like what it is– a reasonable adaptation to an unreasonable situation– and just roll with it, your dates will be more comfortable, and you will have a better time as a result.\n The same applies to phone calls mid-date.  Let them answer the damn phone without drama.  \n They aren’t accusing you of being a dangerous person.  The very fact that they are willing to go on a goddamn date with you means that they have extended a certain level of trust.  But the fact remains that there isn’t really a way to distinguish between “a man who isn’t dangerous” and “a man who knows how to behave like he’s not dangerous.”\n there isn’t really a way to distinguish between “a man who isn’t dangerous” and “a man who knows how to behave like he’s not dangerous.”", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/ascaryghost/672861963386306560/kawuli-aqueerkettleofish-i-know-people-have"}

Only you define your gender!\n Actually there is a good chance that is not the lack of iron making you pass out but instead drops on blood pressure! \n I found this out recently. I’ve always been told my fainting/dizzy spells during my period were iron related but I did some research and because I have a history of low blood pressure and fainting related to it (in times of a restricted diet and pregnancy) it’s far more likely that’s the reason I’m fainting \n A lot of other AFAB people report the same\n I ended up in the hospital due to severe blood loss and needed transfusions to recover\n Not to mention the dip in your immune system when you lose that much blood, just because of all the white blood cells pouring out along with the rest of it. \n Or the fact that a lot of the painful/severe symptoms associated with periods are actually due to medical problems that need to be addressed, but people don’t know this because no one wants to talk about it and associate most of the symptoms with a fictional version of PMS\n That last point is really worth emphasising. \n Look, periods suck, but they’re not supposed to suck so much that you’re genuinely incapacitated for days at a time. If you’re literally in agony every month, then that’s a sign there might be something else going on.\n Pls reblog this could save a life \n *bows in tiny velociraptor*\n thank\n Not to mention that PMS can legitimately make people feel self-destructive and/or briefly suicidal even if they weren’t before and won’t be afterwards.

Shes the only one that doesn't lecture me on eating healthy cause I'm obese \n like I dont care that my last pediatrician talked to me about my weight cause like im obese but it was fucking insulting that he assumed I dont know how to properly eat?? Like he sent me home with a whole ass pamphlet about eating fruits and vegetables and fucking exercising.  After I told him I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.\n bro fr pediatricians suck sm ass all the time. im glad you found a good one finally bc its SO RARE to actually find one that doesnt just say \"lose weight\" to all your problems. (EVEN TO CHILDREN APPARENTLY???) i remember when i was abt 13 and was like a month into my restrictive ed and lost 30lbs, i went to the doctors and she told me that i need to lose some weight (...because i was still overweight). literally one blood test would have proven that i hadnt eaten for like a month, but sHeS tHe pRoFeSsIoNaL i gUeSs.\n Frrr theres so much fat phobia in healthcare its insane T-T I'm sorry you went through that cause you genuinely didn't and dont deserve that. All the stories of people being denied tests an like actual treatment just because theyre overweight make me sick to my stomach :/ \n im sorry past pediatricians have treated you so poortly too, especially when youre already living with a restrictive ed. no one deserves to be pushed to the side and not taken seriously bc of smth like weight.\n the worst part is the effect it has on people who already have insecurities, mentally and physically. i thought for months after that that i just wasnt sick enough, and that i Obviously hadnt lost enough weight to even be considered normal, so i spiraled even harder. then another 50lbs later when my heart was failing that same pediatrician has the nerve to not believe me when i said i was throwing up and starving until she gasped at my weight chart and sound worried. she asssumed that i didnt starve to look the way i did because i still was technically \"normal\" in regards to bmi. she took one look at me and didnt believe me because of my weight, and ONLY believed me once she saw the documented data on my weight drop.\n people are scarily ignorant and its terrifying to imagine how many people werent so lucky and died because of a doctors negligence. its scarily easy to hide an ed when youre overweight, because even if you Tell People youre starving, they wont believe you.", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/ascaryghost/670697943756652544"}

{"user_name": ["ascaryghost", "catwithaknife"], "user_comment": "i hate seeing pro-ana/mia scumbags tell impressionable children that “nothing tastes as good as skinny feels”, because that lie (and a few others) really helped bring to life an eating disorder i still haven’t recovered from a decade later.\n do you want to know how ‘skinny’ really feels?\n ‘skinny’ feels like going from captain of a sports team to someone who nearly faints so much that they become the only student in the school to be removed from PE class.\n ‘skinny’ feels like bombing all of your exams because you’re too hungry to think, and never actually managing to finish school.\n ‘skinny’ feels like dead eyes, dull hair, yellowed teeth and premature ageing. it feels like aching joints, a million bruises, and no resistance to heat or cold. \n ‘skinny’ feels like being too preoccupied with your body to enjoy your youth or even allow yourself to be photographed with the few remaining friends who can tolerate your spaciness and food freakouts.\n ‘skinny’ feels like endlessly waiting for the day when you’re finally light enough to be worthy of love, and weighing your current hunger against this vague point in the future that never comes, because even if you reach the weight you thought you needed to be it still won’t be enough. \n ‘skinny’ feels like being told you’re too bony to hug.\n ‘skinny’ feels like watching everyone else live happy, healthy lives while you can’t even do laundry without getting lightheaded, and wondering if you can undo any of the damage you caused by malnourishing yourself for years.\n i thought that starving myself would somehow fix my life, but all it did was make things worse. i’m 25 years old and i haven’t really accomplished anything since i was 15. people my age are doing things like graduating from university, getting married, having children, and getting cool jobs, and i’m just trying to convince myself that it’s okay to eat more than 1000 calories a day.\n don’t listen to the pro-anas. weighing less isn’t worth risking your future. please eat.
