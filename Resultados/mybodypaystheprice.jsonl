{"user_name": ["mybodypaystheprice", "afeelgoodblog"], "user_comment": "The Best News of Last Week\n 1. \n ‘It was an accident’: the scientists who have turned humid air into renewable power\n Greetings, readers! Welcome to our weekly dose of positivity and good vibes. In this edition, I've gathered a collection of uplifting stories that will surely bring a smile to your face. From scientific breakthroughs to environmental initiatives and heartwarming achievements, I've got it all covered.\n In May, a team at the University of Massachusetts Amherst \n published a paper\n  declaring they had successfully generated a small but continuous electric current from humidity in the air. They’ve come a long way since then. The result is a thin grey disc measuring 4cm across.\n One of these devices can generate a relatively modest 1.5 volts and 10 milliamps. However, 20,000 of them stacked, could generate 10 kilowatt hours of energy a day – roughly the consumption of an average UK household. Even more impressive: they plan to have a prototype ready for demonstration in 2024.\n 2. \n Empty Office Buildings Are Being Turned Into Vertical Farms\n Empty office buildings are being repurposed into vertical farms, such as Area 2 Farms in Arlington, Virginia. With the decline in office usage due to the Covid-19 pandemic, municipalities are seeking ways to fill vacant spaces.\n Vertical farming systems like Silo and \n AgriPlay's \n modular growth systems offer efficient and adaptable solutions for converting office buildings into agricultural spaces. These initiatives not only address food insecurity but also provide economic opportunities, green jobs, and fresh produce to local communities, transforming urban centers in the process.\n 3. \n Biden-Harris Administration to Provide 804,000 Borrowers with $39 Billion in Automatic Loan Forgiveness as a Result of Fixes to Income Driven Repayment Plans\n The Department of Education in the United States has announced that over 804,000 borrowers will have $39 billion in Federal student loans automatically discharged. This is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to fix historical failures in the administration of the student loan program and ensure accurate counting of monthly payments towards loan forgiveness.\n The Department aims to correct the system and provide borrowers with the forgiveness they deserve, leveling the playing field in higher education. This announcement adds to the Administration's efforts, which have already approved over $116.6 billion in student loan forgiveness for more than 3.4 million borrowers.\n 4. \n F.D.A. Approves First U.S. Over-the-Counter Birth Control Pill\n The move could significantly expand access to contraception. The pill is expected to be available in early 2024.\n The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved a birth control pill to be sold without a prescription for the first time in the United States, a milestone that could significantly expand access to contraception. The medication, called \n Opill\n , will become the most effective birth control method available over the counter\n 5. \n AIDS can be ended by 2030 with investments in prevention and treatment, UN says\n It is possible to end AIDS by 2030 if countries demonstrate the political will to invest in prevention and treatment and adopt non-discriminatory laws, the United Nations said on Thursday.\n In 2022, an estimated 39 million people around the world were living with HIV, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program. HIV can progress to AIDS if left untreated.\n 6. \n Conjoined twins released from Texas Children’s Hospital after successfully separated in complex surgery\n Conjoined twins are finally going home after the pair was safely separated during a complex surgery at Texas Children’s Hospital in June.\n Ella Grace and Eliza Faith Fuller were in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for over four months after their birth on March 1. A large team of healthcare workers took six hours to complete the surgery on June 14. Seven surgeons, four anesthesiologists, four surgical nurses and two surgical technicians assisted with the procedure.\n 7. \n From villains to valued: Canadians show overwhelming support for wolves\n Despite their record in popular culture, according to a recent \n survey\n , seven in 10 Canadians say they have a “very positive” view of the iconic predators. \n Here's a fascinating video about how wolves changed Yellowstone nat'l park:\n ----\n That's it for this week :)\n This newsletter\n  will always be free.

{"user_name": ["mybodypaystheprice", "magnetothemagnificent"], "user_comment": "The world is so hostile to tweens.....\n Like we joke about how our schools growing up would ban the latest toy trends, but that reality genuinely horrific when you think about it. Like maybe 1% of the bans were based on safety, but the rest cited reasoning like \n -\"kids were bartering for collectibles\" (kids learning about economics and product value)\n -\"kids were wearing them and the colors were too flashy\" (kids experimenting with self expression and fashion)\n -\"kids were playing with them during lunch and recess instead of using our rusted safety hazard playground\" (kids utilizing their free time to do what helps *them* unwind). \n Play areas specifically geared towards children and especially towards teens are constantly being shut down. \"Oh kids today are always on their phones!\" Maybe because \n -there are barely any arcades left and even less arcades that aren't adult-oriented, \n -public pools and gyms are underfunded and shut down, \n -\"no loitering\" laws prevent kids and teens from just hanging out, \n -movie theatres only play the latest films and ticket prices are only rising, \n -parks and playgrounds are either neglected or replaced with gear only directed at toddlers and unsuitable for anyone older\n -genuine children's and young teen media is being phased out in favour of media directed only at very small children or older teens and adults. \n -suburbs and even cities are becoming more and more hostile to pedestrians, it's just not safe for kids to walk to or ride their bikes to their friends' houses or other play destinations \n Children's agency is hardly ever respected. Kids between the ages of 9-13 are either treated as babies or as full-grown adults, with no in-between. When they ask to be given more independence, they are either scoffed at or given more responsibilities than are reasonable for a child their age. \n This is even evident in the fashion scene. \n Clothing stores and brands like Justice and Gap are either closing or rebranding to either exclusively adult clothing or young children's clothes, with no middle ground for tweens. Tweens have to choose between clothes designed for adults that are too large and/or too mature for their age and bodies, or more clothes they feel are far too childish. For tween girls especially it's either a frilly pinafore dress with pigtails or a woman's size dress with cleavage. No wonder tween girls these days dress like they're older, it's because their other option is little girl clothes and they don't want to feel childish.  \n And then when tweens go to school, the books they want to read aren't available because they cover \"mature\" topics (read: oh no two people kissed and they weren't straight or oh no menstruation was mentioned or oh no a religion other than Christianity is depicted), so kids are left with books for way below their reading level. No wonder kids today are struggling with literacy, it's because they can't exercise and expand their reading skills with age-appropriate books. Readers need to be challenged with new words and concepts in order to grow in their skills, only letting tween read Dr. Seuss and nursery rhymes doesn't let them learn. \n Discussions about substance use, reproduction, and sexuality aren't taught at an age-appropriate level in school or even by children's parents, so they either grow up ignorant and more vulnerable to abuse, or they seek out information elsewhere that is delivered in a less-than-age-appropriate manner. It shouldn't be a coin-toss between \"I didn't know what sex was until I was 18 and in college\" or \"my first exposure to sex as a tween was through porn\" or \"I didn't know what sex was so I didn't know I was being sexually abused as a kid.\" \n Tweenhood is already such a volatile and confusing time for kids, their bodies are changing and they're transitioning from elementary to middle to high school. It's hard enough for them in this stage, but it's made worse by how society devalues and fails them. \n We talk about the disappearance of teenagehood, and maybe that's gonna happen in the future, but the erasure of tweenhood is happing in real time, and it's having and going to have major consequences for next generation's adults.

Because it happened to me.\n I trained for years to be a con artist. I told my friends and family that I wanted to be a magician, but that was just a cover for why I was constantly practicing sleight of hand. \n In junior high and high school, I would shop lift a bunch of candy on my way to school, sell it to kids at the morning break, and use that money to run a crooked poker game at lunch.\n Finally, when I was 19 or 20, I felt I was ready, and I picked my first pocket. I was on the bus, bumped a guy as I passed down the aisle, got his wallet, super clean.\n In the wallet was several hundred dollars. A huge first score, I had been hoping for a couple twenties. I sat there looking at the, like, 400 bucks, thinking.\n That was my rent at the time. We were both on the bus. It was likely his rent too. Lord knows the only reason to carry that much cash on the bus is you’re on your way to pay a bill. \n We were both on the bus,\n  you know? That’s not someone I was comfortable stealing from.\n I tapped him on the shoulder and told him “hey i think you dropped this” and gave it back to him with all the money still in it. It was the first and last time I ever picked a pocket.\n Picking a rich person’s pocket is a loosing game. They probably have credit cards and not cash, those credit cards probably have the best anti-theft measures their bank can provide, and you probably can’t get close enough to those people to pick their pockets unless you’re already rich yourself.\n The people who’s pockets you can reliably pick are the people around you. The people who are also on the bus, who are in this same shitty situation with you.\n As wealth inequality becomes more drastic picking pockets has very clearly become “stealing from other poor people” and it’s not satisfying. I want to steal from Google and Apple and Fox and Facebook and General Mills and Hershey and Tesla. Not the person next to me.\n Wow.

{"user_name": ["mybodypaystheprice", "fatehbaz"], "user_comment": "But what is more upsetting about sugar is its atrocious history. To this day, working conditions in sugar are among the world’s worst.  […]  For nearly five centuries, European planters made dizzying fortunes in sugar, made possible by enslaving workers in colonized lands. […] \n Canadian \n investors, too, have reaped massive sugar profits. During the 1700s and 1800s, most Europeans, in what is now \n Canada\n , were  implicated in the transatlantic sugar and slave trades. \n Not only did  many consume the fruits of the enslaved sugar industry — including  molasses and rum, in addition to sugar, as historian Afua Cooper writes — but some also invested in Caribbean trade, itself powered by enslaved sugar work\n . \n Several Canadian banks — including the Imperial Bank of Commerce and the  Bank of Nova Scotia (now known as Scotiabank) — have their origins in  the West Indies, where their forerunners established themselves early in the 19th century. According to Cooper, \n the Bank of Nova Scotia exists “in the shadow of West Indian slavery.” \n —\n Western Canadians have also profited from unfree sugar labour.\n  The famed  western Canadian brand, Rogers Sugar, was established by American  Benjamin Tingley Rogers\n  who moved to Canada in 1889. Having grown up in  the sugar industry, Rogers had both sugar connections and expertise. \n Building a refinery in Vancouver,  a city newly constructed […], Rogers created a western Canadian sugar empire — one that  sourced raw sugar cane through the Pacific, refined it in British  Columbia and sold it throughout the Canadian West. Railway magnate William Cornelius Van Horne, together with noted investors such as Richard Bladworth Angus, Edmund Boyd Osler and Donald Alexander Smith, were among the ventures’ early shareholders. By the time of his death in 1918, Rogers had become “quite wealthy.” Now owned by Lantic Inc., Rogers Sugar remains a recognized Canadian brand. Less well known, though, is Rogers Sugar’s violent past. […]\n Refined predominantly in Vancouver, Rogers Sugar was made mostly from raw cane sugar.   Since sugar cane cannot grow in Canada, B.C. Sugar sourced internationally […]. \n B.C. Sugar also ventured into sugar cane plantation ownership: in  Fiji between 1905 and 1922, and in the Dominican Republic between 1944  and 1955\n .\n  Notably, it purchased the latter from the Bank of Nova Scotia.\n  In both cases, workers reported horrendous conditions. The pay was so  low and the work was so menial in the Dominican Republic that, as  historian Catherine C. Legrand points out, workers left the plantation whenever they could.\n —\n In Fiji between 1905 and 1920, B.C. Sugar employed indentured workers from India\n  who migrated to the colony on five-year contracts.  […] Forced into hard physical labour with little time for sleep, indentured  workers at B.C. Sugar’s Fiji plantation endured sickness, confinement,  hunger, abuse, injuries, whippings, beatings and more […]. When Fiji de-criminalized the desertion of indenture contracts in 1916,  it is little wonder that hundreds of workers left the colony’s sugar  plantations. […] \n Canadian sugar was built upon violence, including upon enslaved and indentured labour. \n —\n Images, captions, and text by: Donica Belisle. “Uncovering the violent history of the Canadian sugar industry.” \n The Conversation\n . 16 March 2023.

Nobody talks everybody walks. \n People who give out food without a permit, hold a march without a permit, grow a garden without a permit, are more likely to be people you could turn to to work with on preventing an eviction, or keeping people out of cop hands, or helping your friend Jane get crucial healthcare when it’s not legal in your state.\n Communities comfortable with these acts won’t call the cops, and then nobody knows that it’s happening.\n People have got to shift from both the idea that lawful = good/ illegal = bad, and that the illegality of something means that’s the end of it, and the only fight left is to make it legal again.", "comment_url": "https://mybodypaystheprice.tumblr.com/post/720236232278474752"}

Bigoted parents are terrified of their child not being exactly like them so they have to pretend that something like vaccines or peer pressure corrupted them.

{"user_name": ["mybodypaystheprice", "homunculus-argument"], "user_comment": "in Finland, it is illegal to kill a bear when it’s hibernating. If you ask a hunter why that is, a number of them will tell you it’s wrong simply because it is the law, and they don’t make a distinction between what is right, and what is legal. Most people like that are perfectly normal, decent and respectable people, just like the rest of us.\n  But if you ask people who \n think \n about things, the answer is vague. Killing a hibernating bear would just feel… impolite? You can’t fucking shoot a man when he’s sleeping, that’s just fucking rude. It’s just not the right thing to do.\n  Long before hunting laws were established in Finland, you couldn’t kill a sleeping bear, and what commands you is something older than law: tradition. Even at a time when hunting was a matter of life and death, and a bear fighting for its life is mainly a matter of death, you just didn’t kill a hibernating bear, you have to wake it up first. Hunters risked their lives, the lives of their brothers and everyone in the hunting party, who were friends, family and men that they loved, to give the bear a fighting chance.\n  In the modern time, the hunting season of bears is in the summer, for the warmest summer months. There are many reasons for why they are allowed to tread safely in autumn and to sleep in peace through the cold months, almost all of which are rational and scientific, and do not touch the old traditions.\n  Old faith says a living thing has many souls - \n henki, luonto, itse\n . Plants only have one - the one that wills them to grow. Animals have two, both the spark of life and nature that enables them to act. A human being also has the third, one that makes them a person, personality, \n itse\n , literally “self”. But the soul that travels in your dreams is not the soul that defines a human - animals have that one as well. When your dog runs in her sleep, her soul is elsewhere, where a dog is needed.\n  One’s waking soul is elsewhere when they sleep and dream. A bear’s soul is somewhere else when they are hibernating - there are two words for “hibernation” in finnish, one of which is \n talviuni\n , “winter sleep”, and that is the one that bears have - and if you kill a sleeping bear, their soul is not in the body, it is still out there, and it can find you, and as a revenge for killing its body, Ghost Bear will kill your entire fucking family.", "comment_url": "https://mybodypaystheprice.tumblr.com/post/719819442731745280/keuhkopussirotta-in-finland-it-is-illegal-to"}

She asks herself each day, “What are you going to do today to resist domination?” I also really liked it when she said that in order to move from pain to power, it is crucial to engage in “an active rewriting of our lives.” \n I have come to think of the suicidal impulse as the brain waving a flag to say three things:\n something needs to change here\n this is urgent\n I don’t know how to do it\n death is the ultimate metaphor for drastic change. it’s a general specific. whatever your problems are, it is very likely that dead people don’t have to deal with them. a real solution to your problems may demand a very narrow range of action that’s likely to be out of reach at this moment, but death is sold on every street corner, so it feels like a more realistic fantasy than happiness.\n you don’t really want to die per se but it’s also not completely random chemicals swamping your brain for no reason. you want the pain to stop, you want to be somewhere else, you want to be someone else. it’s urgent. you don’t know how to do it. the end is not the end but a means that feels within your reach right now.\n this is the wisdom of bell hooks: daily rituals of meaning and resistance and solidarity are part of slowly building a future where you can make the change you really need. and only alive people can do that. every step you take towards change and power is another step away from death.", "comment_url": "https://mybodypaystheprice.tumblr.com/post/716702957109985280/bell-hooks-mentioned-going-through-a-time-in-her"}

I was peeling bark off a tree on public property to calm my anxiety.\n Two officers pulled up very quietly in a squad car while I had my back turned. They did not announce their arrival. When I noticed them approaching me by the sound of their footsteps, I was frightened and reached for my phone to record them. They thought I was going for a weapon and one reached for his pistol. I put my hands up. \n They illegally detained me and took my ID to run a background check. The one who had started to draw his gun on me asked me if I’d had any thoughts of hurting myself or others.\n My background check came up clean. They released me and told me I wasn’t doing anything illegal. I went to my car and bawled my eyes out, thinking about how I’d almost died for the crime of “weird behavior.”\n Don’t give these pigs a registry of the mentally ill. They’re already trying to kill us for no good reason.\n editing the rb because people in the comments are stupid as fuck.\n “it’s some cops not all cops, you lumping everyone together is not helpful” some cops is already too much cops. of course it’s not \n all\n  cops ever, everyone knows that. but even some cops are enough and too much.\n “they thought you were on drugs!!” so? how is a drugged up person who isn’t doing anything harmful, because last I checked peeling bark off trees isn’t gonna kill the tree or harm anyone or anything, just guilty? people really like to shit on addicts as if they weren’t people too. does an addict who isn’t doing anything else than being high deserve to be shot is what you’re implying? because if so, smokers and drunks also do, since they’re doing substances in public. ooooh but then again if someone’s on cocaine it’s bad and deserves to die but if someone chains smokes it’s all good it’s just tobacco anyway it’s not a real addiction? fuck you in particular. \n “I reported your comment for threatening violence” yes let me just reach for this pocket guillotine so I can easily execute you. are you okay? do you need a hug?\n “you should have alerted the cops that it was a phone and not a weapon” as if cops don’t just shoot people for having a toy in their hand. if cops see you reaching for anything and their first instinct is to draw their guns on you, then it doesn’t matter what you had in your hand, the cops are just looking for an excuse to shoot. cops don’t care if you tell them it’s just a phone, they don’t think “ooh it’s just a phone it’s okay then!” and put their guns away, they’re still gonna have their guns pointed at you “just in case” and are still gonna shoot you if you do anything they don’t like.\n I don’t really know how to tell you that if I’m having a weapon pointed at me in any situation I couldn’t be calm and collected, because I could die any moment now. how the hell is anyone supposed to just be “I’m just reaching for my phone slowly! nothing dangerous!” when someone is preparing to shoot them? are you going to be rational when you’re drowning knowing that you could die any moment? because I’m gonna the fuck not. I’m going to panic and all I’m going to think is “I’m gonna die”. if you can remain calm and just have a nice dialogue with someone who could kill you just because you looked a little too suspicious to them, good for you, I guess. \n if your first thought of a story of police violence is “this is fake/this didn’t happen/it’s your fault for not doing xyz thing” then I love to break it to you that I hope you never talk to any mentally ill person or any victim again ever. of anything. just don’t talk to anyone really. you’re part of the problem and you decided to side with the oppressor AND oppress the victim at the same time, you’re really the smartest and kindest person in an empty room.\n acab. 1312 if you will.

The commend reads: This doesn’t make a ton of sense to me either. Setting aside the question of whether gender/sex is assigned or observed at birth, the gender I was assigned at birth was ‘boy.’ The gender I have now is ‘man’. Boys and men have different gender roles, and few adults identify as boys anymore. From this standpoint, every adult has a different gender than the one they had at birth. End ID]\n Framing “girl” and “boy” as separate genders from “woman” and “man” is such an amazing take. it’s a framework that accommodates and explains so many trans experiences. Some trans people never were their AGAB. Some feel like they were their AGAB, but that that changed (usually when puberty hits, which is when you start “becoming a man/woman”. The accepted societal path is that girls grow up to into women, and boys grow up into men. But some girls grow up into men, and some boys grow up into women. This guy was a boy who grew up into a man, which generally works out pretty well for people. Some boys and girls grow up into people who aren’t men or women, even!

{"user_name": ["mybodypaystheprice", "callmepersephoni"], "user_comment": "Because I am partly on Eating-Disorder-Tumblr and I can’t make everyone recover; here are some tips from a witch that is struggling with bulimic anorexia for anyone who might struggle with any purging-type ED: \n Do not brush your teeth after purging, same goes for after eating, because this may brush acid into your teeth.\n Use mouth wash instead \n Also use a tongue cleaner \n And when brushing your teeth use sensitive \n dental floss\n  \n Eat cashews, they help with caries, chew really well\n When you have already damaged your sphincter and/or developed a gastritis go to the doctor. Get yourself some meds. \n If\n  \n you can’t afford going to the doctor identify your triggers (i live in germany we have a health care system but idk where y’all are live) \n Take electrolytes, isotonic sport drinks also work, when you purge your electrolytes won’t be intact which can lead to real heart damage and electrolytes will prevent dizziness, low heart rates etc. \n Also try to get some sugar in your system after purging, i can’t get a real answer through research but somehow my insulin goes down after to the point I fainted to many times.\n But please don’t eat like for half an hour after purging (your stomach lining is irritated so if you eat that could easily lead to purging again which kind of makes everyone of us upset or if you don’t have a gastritis you trigger the development) \n When you purge something that looks like strawberry jam or coffee ground, go to the hospital immediately. That is a sign of internal bleeding and that may need a) strong medication or with high probability b) an operation\n If you know that you damaged your organs, try to be aware of the fact that you need to eat more for a certain time and move less while sleeping more because you body needs to heal \n (more about that at the end) \n KNOW YOUR TRIGGERS \n Which\n  foods (may) trigger my mental purging urge? \n Which circumstances trigger my mental purging urge? (A certain time, a certain stress level, a certain sound/person/discussion whatever. Know your triggers. Write them down. And be aware of them.\n  (For example my fear foods are triggers, but also when I am stressed, have experienced rejection, my parents arguing, my sister bringing home food for me, and I know that at like 11pm my binging urge gets strong because this is when I ate when I tried to recover because my parents were asleep and they couldn’t judge me for eating because they were used to me not eating or worried because sometimes I managed to purge every meal I have eaten, so sometimes when I didn’t eat anything and would eat a twix that lead to purging but also when I ate normally and felt slightly too full this lead to purging, know when u are ALMOST satisfied if feeling full triggers you, it triggers me) \n Which foods (may) trigger my physical purging urge? \n (When u can’t hold food in) Like I have said this is only for those who may developed a gastritis or reflux due to sphincter-damage. \n Things that are usually triggering are caffeine, sparkling water or soft drinks, too much water at once, and eating after drinking too much, high-fat products, for me dairy was a huge problem, fish, meat high-acid fruit such as orange or lemon and much more.\n  I have a list for myself but it is important for you to know your trigger foods of both mentally and physically dependent purging-urge and THEN identify your limit because developing new fear foods because of my gastritis and sphincter-damage made everything pretty much worse. You can eat those things but u need to have some sort of moderation. (F.ex. Many of my actual safe foods triggered my reflux well and then I was left with almost nothing to eat which stressed me the fuck out which again made my bpd much worse than it could have been)\n Okay, these ones are more like a witchy/spiritual tips, but oh my dear Hecate i swear they work and make everything SO MUCH EASIER:\n Take healing earth capsules. In Germany you can get them at every drug store. Idk if it is the placebo or if they really work but it lessens your symptoms of post-purge damage. \n Drink tea. Fennel, Lavender, Chamomile, nettle ginger and many more herbs help with stomach issues but drink whatever you like, also each herb has a personal meaning for me in my practice, use that as placebo. For example you can see lavender as herb to help you with self acceptance, calmness, self forgiveness and/or overall health. But you need to find your own meaning and embrace it :) \n LISTEN TO HEALING FREQUENCIES WHILE LAYING DOWN ON YOUR BED. CLOSE YOUR EYES. LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR STOMACH/AND OR GENERAL DIGESTIVE TRACT AND IMAGINE HOW A HEALING LIGHT IS COMING FROM YOUR HANDS. IMAGINE HOW YOUR CELLS ARE NEW FORMING AND HEALING, IMAGINE AND FEEL WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE HEALTHY. IMAGINE WHAT YOU WANT TO FEEL LIKE BE PRECISELY. DO THIS EVERY DAY FOR AT LEAST 10 DAYS. I SWEAR THIS WORKS IT IS MAGICAL. \n Manifest that you stop purging. Manifest that shit. Write things down that you are looking forward to when you stopped purging. Track your progress, tell people (or literally anything) about it that you know could be proud of you. Speak it out loud. You don’t have anyone to talk to? Fine. Write a post even though nobody reads it. Talk to your stuffed animals “I didn’t purge today, I am proud of me, when I stop purging I can eat normally again and dance because i don’t feel too nauseous to do what I love”, create an environment that helps you with that, have a person you look up to be like. Look at your progress and actually recognize it. Create feelings you want to feel with your mind and eventually you will feel them. \n Reblog and add more if you like, someone may need it if u know it or not", "comment_url": "https://mybodypaystheprice.tumblr.com/post/713876311520722944"}

I got special awards for how many books I read, I wrote little blurbs on why i loved the books (probably why I love to BETA and do ARCs) \n PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE Just hit the green arrows and the reblog!!!\n As a 50 year old woman, the library offers me so much. Digital art pads to borrow, 3D printing, book clubs that are face to face (yeah, the introvert likes face to face because a moderator will stomp on anyone getting snarky)\n New books in LARGE PRINT! I’m visually challenged and as much as I love my kindle, The feel of a real book in my hands will always be a beloved feeling!\n Our library also has quarterly books sales of almost free books!! For 5$USD we get in a day early and can buy as many as we want. Anyone else has to wait and there is a limit for the first 2 days.\n Also many, many libraries have inter library loan(it may be called something different). This means if they don’t have the item you want, they can get it for you.  This may include photocopy/pdf of articles.   This can also include along with books and DVDs, microfilm/fiche which is also a huge resource.  Check around for libraries that are listed as depositories if you want to look at government documents.  \n Remember that many colleges and universities have open stacks for the public.  You will likely have to pay a membership fee but you will get to stuff. \n I love the library ☺\n The library was one of my favorite places to go as a kid and I still live to go and just. Sit and read. Or do homework. The university I’m at has a \n massive\n  8-story one I love to just wonder around in~ Great places\n Libraries are amazing places, we need to protect them to ensure their continued existence.  \n I used to wander about the fiction section in my local library, and choose books with the most interesting titles - I discovered two amazing authors that way \n If you feel disconnected from your local community & want to find ways to get involved, seriously consider spending some time at the library. Go to some events! Organize a reading group! \n This is why I’m gonna study to be a librarian!

Like it's not that big a stretch of the imagination for someone to think \"oh I like warm milk but I also like this acidic fruit, I wonder if I can mix them\". From there a little experimentation on separating the new curd from the whey and you've got a simple fresh cheese. \n I dunno I think the reason I wanted to make this post is just that we tend to desscribe a lot of discoveries around food as desperate acts of starvation and not genuinely thought out experimentations based on observations like every other form of human knowledge.

I'm just pissed at the amount of articles I run across talking about the \"online anorexia cult seducing children\". Because you know what? The problem did not start with your kid being online, the problem started with YOU. People with a healthy self image do not spontaneously struggle with disordered eating.\n If you've ever made a demeaning comment about someone's - anyone's! - body, you can shut right the fuck up about how horrified you are at people starving themselves. You're a perpetrator in this. Your words are an affirmation of things that already echo in our thoughts.\n There is no anorexia cult seducing youths to starve themselves. You planted the seed, buddy. Can these communities be toxic? Hell yeah, they can be. Can these communities be a breeding ground for negative interaction? Hell yeah, they can be. You put a bunch of vulnerable people in one place, it's gonna take a lot to get positivity out of them. But it isn't the fault of other people in your offspring's ana group chat that your offspring wants shelter and people to understand them. YOU were supposed to provide that, YOU were supposed to teach healthy relationships with self image, and you fucking failed. So you can shut the fuck up about how upset and disgusted you are.\n Every time you comment on your daughter's clothing, every time you misgender your son, every time you expect your child to obey and be unquestioning, you are planting seeds and watering them. You are the one that made your daughter realize clothes might fit better if she skips a few meals. You are the one that made your son desperate enough to starve himself so that he could have lanugo. You are the one that exhibited a lack of consent in boundaries, creating a snowball towards the conclusion that being skinny might be the only thing your kid can be in control of in their life.\n Quit being horrified. Quit being disgusted. Shut the fuck up or change how you treat people. You don't get to sit back and be shocked at the damage you did and act like it was someone else. Or, if you don't have the dignity to not be horrified and disgusted, at least don't blame other people because you were a shitty fucking parent.", "comment_url": "https://mybodypaystheprice.tumblr.com/post/712209291537514496"}

But I think we should really work on it. And that's saying \"if this were a physical illness, wouldn't you care?\"\n I've learned that no actually, people wouldn't care. Katelyn Weinstein (theADHDprincess on Twitter) is a neurodiversity acceptance activist who really put this in perspective for me. She said that it's actually more an issue of longevity than physical vs mental health.\n If you're having a bad day people will generally be understanding. But when you're experiencing chronic depression and you have many bad days people lose sympathy.\n In the same respect people may be understanding when you've broken a bone that will heal properly or when you have a cold that will go away soon in ways they simply won't understand when you have chronic pain or need to use a wheelchair. They may send chicken soup for a temporary situation, but when you need consistent accomodations it's an entirely different story.\n I understand that from our perspective it looks like people care more about physical health than mental health, but it's good to remember that our own perspective is also limiting. Facing ableism doesn't mean you can't be ableist. And I know so many people are not ill-intentioned when they say this. I know I wasn't. But we can't discount the lived experiences of physically disabled people. If we want true equality we need to be united and we need to listen to those with physical disabilities and illnesses. And those with physical disabilities and illnesses (some of which are also invisible) have said that they are not given proper accomodations either.\n So let's be united and fight for equality and accomodations for everyone, no matter what their illness or disability may be.", "comment_url": "https://mybodypaystheprice.tumblr.com/post/711452162765520897"}

If you raise your voice even a little — regardless of what you say or how you say it — you are instantly labeled an 'angry Black woman' and judged wrongly, even when you’re right.\"\n \"My mother taught me to ALWAYS ask for a bag and receipt, no matter how small the purchase, or you can be accused of stealing.\"\n \"As a Black woman in a predominantly white area, I make a point of approaching staff first in stores when I walk in. I ask an innocuous question in a friendly, high-pitched voice, even if I don't need anything. They seem to feel safer around me and do not follow me around when I do that first.\"\n \"As a Black woman, I usually keep my college jacket in the car.

When I take a walk for exercise, I always walk in the middle of the street, not too close to houses on either side. I wear reflective gear and avoid staring too closely at any of the houses. I often think of Ahmaud Arbery while I’m walking.\"\n \"I was taught to be an overachiever because no one expects a Black woman to be smart and well-spoken. I’m not expected to have a voice in anything, and many are shocked when I do. They are astounded when I can verbalize my thoughts and opinions in multi-syllable words. Melanin and ovaries do not cancel out intelligence and reason.\"\n \"As a Black man, my father taught me, when being pulled over by the police, to pull your insurance and registration out of the glovebox and keep it ready on your seat. That way, you do not have to reach in the glovebox when the police are at your window.\"\n \"Never EVER put your hands in your pockets while walking around a store. If you don't want to give them a reason to follow you around or call the police, your hands need to be visible at all times.\"\n \"As a Black man, never get into an elevator with a woman alone. Always wait for the next one.\"\n \"Something I know I have to be careful of in public (as a person mixed with white and Black) is remembering which parent I'm with and how to act. This is called code-switching. I have to make sure I act okay so I'm not labelled as 'ghetto' with my mom or 'white-washed' with my dad.\"\n \"No matter how cold or windy it is, my hood stays off, and my earbuds/headphones stay off my ears.\"\n \"As a Black man who loves hip-hop, I often have to censor the music that I listen to so I won't be judged as a 'thug.'\"\n \"As a Black man, if there is a white woman in line, you stand back far enough so you cannot touch her by mistake or be accused of touching her.\"\n \"Knowing that I’ll be followed when shopping in high-end stores, I have product-related questions prepared for when they invariably ask me if I need assistance. Replying with 'No thank you, I’m just browsing' makes their suspicion jump, and suddenly, I have an unofficial entourage. I’m a college-educated Black man about to turn 40, but I still have to play these sorts of silly games. It can be very exhausting.\"\n \"As a Black woman who works a swing shift and gets off work at 11 p.m., I will not take off my badge until I get inside my garage. I need to have a layer of protection to prove I'm not up to no good in case I get pulled over.\"\n \"When meeting with executives or high-ranking officials where appropriate attire would be business casual for others, I wear full business attire. I’ve found that when I dress more formally, I receive more eye contact, head-nodding, and enthusiasm during conversations. This happens consistently.\"\n \"I work in the hospital. Any time I get a patient out of bed, and they ask me to move their purse, I make sure it remains in their sight as I move it. I also hope that it’s a room with a camera, just in case any discrepancy comes up.\"\n \"Don’t wear any jewelry/sunglasses of the brand where you are shopping in-store. As a Black woman, I’ve had an employee rip Gucci shades off my head (they were mine) and tell me not to stretch the merchandise.\"\n \"Never let your kids play with toy guns.\"\n And finally, \"I find myself begging to get adequate medical care for the autoimmune disease and pain I deal with.

{"user_name": ["mybodypaystheprice", "all-pacas"], "user_comment": "I finished my Rome book and have now begun one about Pompeii. I’m 65 pages in and I already love it: yes, it covers the volcano, but most of the book is about “this is what the town and daily life of it would have been like, actually.” Fascinating stuff. Things I’ve learned so far:\n - The streets in Pompeii have sidewalks sometimes a meter higher than the road, with stepping stones to hop across as “crosswalks.” I’d seen some photos before. The book points out that, duh, Pompeii had no underground drainage, was built on a fairly steep incline, and the roads were more or less drainage systems and water channels in the rain. \n - Unlike today, where “dining out” is expensive and considered wasteful on a budget, most people in Pompeii straight up didn’t have kitchens. You had to eat out if you were poor; only the wealthy could afford to eat at home. \n - Most importantly, and I can’t believe in all the pop culture of Pompeii this had never clicked for me: Pompeii had a population between 6-35,000 people. Perhaps 2,000 died in the volcano. Contemporary sources talk about the bay being full of fleeing ships. Most people got the hell out when the eruption started. The number who died are still a lot, and it’s still gruesome and morbid, but it’s not “an entire town and everyone in it.” This also makes it difficult for archeologists, apparently (and logically): those who remained weren’t acting “normally,” they were sheltering or fleeing a volcano. One famous example is a wealthy woman covered in jewelry found in the bedroom in the glaridator barracks. Scandal! She must have been having an affair and had it immortalized in ash! The book points out that 17 other people and several dogs were also crowded in that one small room: far more likely, they were all trying to shelter together. Another example: Houses are weirdly devoid of furniture, and archeologists find objects in odd places. (Gardening supplies in a formal dining room, for example.) But then you remember that there were several hours of people evacuating, packing their belongings, loading up carts and getting out… maybe the gardening supplies were brought to the dining room to be packed and abandoned, instead of some deeper esoteric meaning. The book argues that this all makes it much harder to get an accurate read on normal life in a Roman town, because while Pompeii is a brilliant snapshot, it’s actually a snapshot of a town undergoing major evacuation and disaster, not an average day.\n - Oh, another great one. Outside of a random laundry place in Pompeii, someone painted a mural with two scenes. One of them referenced Virgil’s Aeneid. Underneath that scene, someone graffiti’d a reference to a famous line from that play, except tweaked it to be about laundry. This is really cool, the book points out, because it implies that a) literacy and education was high enough that one could paint a reference and have it recognized, and b) that someone else could recognize it and make a dumb play on words about it and c) the whole thing, again, means that there’s a certain amount of literacy and familiarity with “Roman pop culture” even among fairly normal people at the time.
