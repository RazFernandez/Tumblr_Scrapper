The fact that many posts are chains of relevant additions or Bits done by multiple people is the appeal. This is not an “outdated format” or an inconvenience, \n it is a core function\n .\n Also I can’t help but suspect that this partial walkback is misleading. Okay, so we still get to have a chronological dashboard, \n but are we going to be allowed to keep it as our default tab? Because new accounts sure fucking can’t set as such.\n Reblog chains are literally what makes tumblr posts tumblr posts ", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/anapurpledinosaur/723158028552208384/headspace-hotel-astraltrickster-relaxxattack"}

It’s always the person sways a little, collapses in one movement, and then is unconscious for like… fucking ages??? They wake up hours later tucked under a blanket and it’s acted like that’s normal. It’s NOT. A person that’s fainted should be back with you pretty quickly, actually: \n (From NHS website)\n I had an experience in my last work place where I fainted, but because it looks so different to how it’s shown in film and TV my managers had no idea what had happened. Here’s a comparison of usual media vs my actual fainting that they were all confused by-\n Films, TV shows, plays etc:\n 1) Person goes “oh goodness” or something similar whilst holding hand to chest\n 2) eyes roll back, gracefully falls to the floor\n 3) nearby people see the poor fainted person, pick them up, put them on a bed or sofa\n 4) person comes to hours or even days later with no idea what happened and everyone else is just like “oh good you’ve woken up 🙂”\n My usual fainting experience:\n 1) Everything starts spinning. Incapable of making words as my sole focus is on trying to get myself to the ground ASAP\n 2) Stumble to floor/chair/ anything I can lean against\n 3) Quick violent slump as actual faint occurs. There is no dainty falling- the whole body has hit shut down. Usually smack my head on the floor if I haven’t managed to get myself somewhere soft \n 4) Aware of surroundings almost immediately, but takes a few seconds to fully come back round\n 5) Carefully sit back up and explain to everyone going “what the fuck happened” that I fainted, and no, I do not need smelling salts actually.\n Image description: \n If you see someone faint\n If you're with someone who has fainted, try to keep calm. \n If you can, lay them on their back and raise their legs.\n Usually, the person who has fainted will wake up within 20 seconds.\n Call [emergency services in your country] if:\n Someone faints and they: \n cannot be woken up after 1 minute\n have severely hurt themselves from a fall\n are shaking or jerking because of a seizure or fit", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/anapurpledinosaur/708987412488093696"}

INTIMATE!! maybe if you say it quickly and in a jokey way its ok but in a serious talk??? it feels too much!!!!!!!\n “i love you” is NOTHING compared to te amo. i love you feels like a kiss on the check and te amo feels like fucking marriage. \n #I have like a whole thing on saying te amo to anyone\n   \n YEA. i had a relationship with someone and she dropped the “te amo” super quicky and i was like…………”thats ok, thank you, but im gonna be honest w you….i’m not saying te amo until i really feel it” thats how serious it is. \n te amo\n  IS very serious, very deep, very intimate. when you want to tell someone that you love them without it being massive, the term you want is \n te quiero\n cant believe no one had contributed this\n Same for German imho?!??? \n Ich liebe dich\n  is THE confession. You don’t drop it in a joking way. \n It might just be me, but I wouldn’t randomly pepper \n Я люблю тебя\n  into conversation either. It feels… too much.\n Maybe it is the English one that is weird\n I tell my close friends “I love you” all the time. I think It’s different if I were to say “I’m in love with you”. \n In these non-English languages, do parents not tell their children “I love you?” Or is it only romantic?\n Oh, I’m monolingual but I know a bit about this one! :D\n So, in a lot of languages, there are multiple verbs that mean, “to love,” which are each \n situational,\n  while, in English, we derive the meaning through \n context\n Like, “Te quiero,” refers to love for friends and family, aka platonic love, while , “Te amo,” or, “Ai shiteru,” in Japanese, is so achingly tender and romantic that you might as well write the other person a receipt for your heart, because it’s theirs now\n At some point, English \n did\n  have multiple verbs for, “to love,” but eventually English speakers decided, “to hell with it, I only want 1 broad term for these big mushy feelings,” because we hate having multiple words for things almost as much as we hate punctuation\n TL;DR: cultures that are non-English speaking do tell their kids they love them, they just have multiple words that mean, “To love,” and English is the odd man out because it got tired of that and went\n ALT\n Just adding that the “te amo” thing is way more nuanced. At least in Puerto Rican culture we do tell our family and friends te amo, BUT it’s still not used nearly as lightly as it is in English. There IS something more intense about it and you’d use it in more intimate circumstances, but it’s definitely not just romantic.", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/anapurpledinosaur/707813719426711552/pidoop-ebonyheartnet-elfwreck"}

Not because Tumblr finally gave us polls and the first thing we did was use them as a medium for cooperative games that aren’t polls. But because they keep succeeding! The E poll aside (excused because I think a lot of the respondents didn’t understand the aim), these polls are really really good at getting the desired result.\n Which is amazing when you think about it, because\n  the respondents don’t see the result until they click\n . Until we participate, we don’t know how long the dick is! We don’t know how big the balls are! We have no idea which snail is ahead! We have to make a guess on what other users have done and behave accordingly. “Oh yeah, but there’s a lot of respondents, just using probability you can – ” do you know how much variation you get in probability? And yet every time I see those snails, they are NECK AND NECK. That penis always has appropriately sized balls that are approximately the same size, to within about 4% of the poll! You’d think everyone would play it safe and just make a dick, but no – people knew it needed balls, they made a guess as to whether other people were giving it balls, and the proportions worked out! It could’ve gone the other way; lots of people could’ve been like ‘oh I be no one is doing the balls’ and they could be massive balls with a micropenis. Or one testicle could’ve gotten all the attention by accident, and we could’ve had a single-ball cock on our hands. But respondents are predicting each others’ behaviour with amazing precision, giving us results far more precise than you’d expect from random generation over so many different polls! Those snails are at EXACTLY FIFTY PER CENT every time I see them!\n I am so proud of our collectively drawn dick and balls you guys.\n Honestly it’s starting to weird me out.", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/anapurpledinosaur/707378731456544768/derinthescarletpescatarian"}

Trying to find the words to doctors why you did it. All you wanted was for it all to stop, but it was the most heartbreaking, painful both mentally and physically, draining thing you went through. Maybe you woke up with regret, maybe with relief. \n But after you get back out in the real world, you have to act like nothing happened. You have to keep living surviving after something so traumatic. You still think about that event over and over. What would it be like if it worked? Why didn't it work? The way you did it, triggers you every time you see that thing/place. You get flashbacks. Ambulances make you re-remember everything all over again.\n If you've survived, I'm proud you're still here. You're a survivor. Life might not look like it's worth it sometimes, but your future holds something amazing for you, I promise it does get better. Little by little. Don't give up just yet. \n 💕", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/anapurpledinosaur/705744739104931840"}

{"user_name": ["anapurpledinosaur", "girlgerard", "girlgerard", "a-kiss-inthe-dreamhouse"], "user_comment": "five years ago i would make jokes about how people would still believe gerard was cishet even if he pranced around in miniskirts and heels and it’s not even funny anymore because that’s exactly what’s happened\n the most infuriating part of this is that the skirts and heels aren’t even the most important part of my chem’s long, long history with queerness.\n gerard way is \n deeply\n  literate in queer media and culture. they’re part of a queer comic writer’s anthology. he was interviewed for and included himself under an article titled ‘queer innovators’ in 2018. they’ve spent this whole tour referencing fright night and camp films. he’s personally called in to drag shows just to tell trans people who were originally inspired to transition because of him that he’s proud of them and everything that they are. they formed their musical identity based on sapphic riot grrrl scenes. they were first drawn to bowie and nirvana specifically because of their bisexuality and gender nonconformity. they’re obsessed with rocky horror and drag culture in general. they deliberately curated their audience to center women and lgbt folks, using visible queerness to dissuade violent rock dudes from even wanting to attend their shows. they wrote personal narrative songs about gay sex in an era where having long hair made you a target for a hate crime. he made out with his male guitarist in front of an entire crowd of rowdy rock fans just to piss them off and decry homophobia in the \n early 2000s\n . they wore passing drag when they were in college because they wanted to see what it was like to live as a woman. good fucking god he spent two entire years openly and almost ravenously discussing his own lifelong struggles with gender incongruity, how they wished they’d had access to gender-focused therapy when they were younger, how when they, as a teen, learned what transgenderism was, they immediately understood themself as ‘more of a girl’, and how they felt like a light switch went off in their head when they read what laura jane had written about her experience with dysphoria, something that affected them enough they explicitly wrote about transfemininity and transphobia in a personal solo album where they only referred to themself with she/her pronouns. \n and this isn’t even fucking half of it! they tweeted their goddamn pronouns seven years ago! \n gerard is deeply, deeply rooted in queer culture, and he has been so despite extreme personal hardship. \n god, it’s not just about gerard, either. the way people treat my chem’s queerness is infuriating as well.\n mcr has always been a queer band.\n  ideologically, identification-wise, politically, artistically, whatever you want to call it, they have always, \n always\n  been a queer band. gerard wearing eyeshadow and deliberately presenting femininely during revenge was a declaration. frank pasting ‘PANSY’ in the biggest letters he could on his guitar was a declaration. gerard’s speeches against homophobia in the early days was a declaration. and these statements weren’t just political, they were \n personal\n . gerard has gone on record saying that they looked the way they did in 2004 because it was affirming to their femininity and gender identity! the reason they made those anti-homophobia speeches in the early days was in direct response to being called faggots backstage at that gig! my chemical romance has always been a queer band by queer people writing queer music for a queer audience and somehow people have managed, by some godforsaken feat, to twist that queerness into being purely \n coincidental\n .\n during the breakup, mcr somehow became a ‘gay band’ the same way that hozier was ‘gay music’ or mushrooms were ‘gay culture’. people suddenly decided mcr was queer not because presenting that way was an extremely deliberate decision by the band members, but simply because gay people liked them. just like how mother mother became ‘enby music’, my chem became queer only by association. and what utter bullshit that is. after all they went through, after all they’d done and sang and spoken and curated, for their queerness to be reduced down to a simple coincidental aesthetic. \n look. i get it. we don’t want to overstep. but this has bridged into \n complete\n  overcorrection. the fact that all of this history has been capped off by a world tour where gerard has been, and i’m gonna say it, completely, undeniably, and wonderfully queer, out in public without any restrictions for the first time in their entire life, and people have STILL managed to raise their hackles at the thought of calling them and their band queer is…somewhat offensive to be honest! we’ve lost the language of flagging and subtlety (though i wouldn’t call any of my chem’s history with queerness subtle), and have overcorrected to the point of forcing people to come out with a pleasantly packaged and explicit label before they can \n ever\n  be included in the political sphere of queerness. what happened to ‘cishet isn’t the default’ and ‘coming out on life magazine isn’t a necessity to be lgbt’? \n this band has done so fucking much to find hands to hold, not just for their audience’s comfort, but to connect with people they can identify with. what a gift that is. if you look at mcr’s entire discography, everything the band has said about not fitting in and being bullied for being faggots, everything gerard’s said about their own gender identity, everything they have ever aligned themselves with, everything that has happened onstage these past five months, everything, and i can’t believe i’m saying this, including \n gerard yanking a trans pride flag out of the audience pit and \n literally waving it around onstage, \n and your conclusion is ‘well i don’t want to \n assume\n …’, you’ve missed the point in its entirety.\n Not to derail op’s excellent post but to add some (rambling)perspective from a trans fan who has watched all this unfold since 2004–\n Some people legit just don’t understand what the scene (hell, the world!) was like when MCR hit the mainstream. A band might occasionally flirt with the concept of queerness in an abstract way or only to shock. A band might wear some makeup for the shock factor or otherwise get attention. Rock bands wanted to be labeled masculine or at the minimum, comfortably neutral so as not to piss off the wrong people.\n MCR were so powerful because there was a VISIBLE and TANGIBLE element of queerness to them. They were labeled a girly band.  They were dangerous because you had lyrics like “well don’t I look pretty walking down the street in the best damn dress I own”, Gerard (in 2004, mind you) openly talking about wearing women’s clothing, wearing make up that was less ‘rockstar’ more ‘gender affirming’, the whole kissing on stage thing,  and also vocally supporting their LGBT+ fans when other bands would only offer the vaguest hints of possible support.\n That was something a band getting airtime on MTV didn’t do back then. At least not with the openness that MCR did. Why? Because it could’ve ended your career if not your life. Being gay was still illegal in a lot of states at the time. Same-sex marriage was a pipe dream we thought only our grandkids would see. There wasn’t many openly gay characters in television or movies and being anything other than cishet was always the punchline. Yet, they were out there on MTV talking about sucking more dick than David Cassidy and shit talking homophobes. That took guts.\n MCR was always a queer band. Full stop.

{"user_name": ["anapurpledinosaur", "melodiesforyouandme"], "user_comment": "This Is My Life Story - This post is long and not going to be an easy read. Abuse; TW. Death Mention; TW.\n HI, my name is Sylvianne, I am 21 years old, I live in Canada. This is my life situation. Since I was one year old, I was violated physically, and mentally abused by my birth family. When I was 13 years old, I started to run away, and I took shelter in friends’ homes with different friends, anything to not sleep at home. My birth family called the police and reported me missing, they told the police that brought me home one night, they did not want to take care of me anymore, and if the officer left me there they would toss me back onto the street. The officer took me to the police station, and I slept on a couple of chairs in a room, waiting to see what will happen. An adult woke me up and said they were going to take me to a children’s aid receiving home. I was to stay there for 2 weeks while they find me a permanent home. I stayed there and I waited the 2 weeks. When they put me into a permanent home, I was mentally abused. So, I did what I knew and ran away. The police picked me up, and I was put in another permanent home. Unfortunately, they were all in it for the money, and they were all abusive in one way or another.\n Since they had trouble keeping me in one place, they put me into a detention center, basically juvenile jail. When I was admitted to the detention center, I was instructed to remove all my clothes, bend over for inspection, and next I was told to shower, and given some hospital like clothing to put on. I asked for my own underwear back, but they refused. I argued, because I did not want to wear the underwear they gave me, they were old. They assured me they were washed in bleach, and they refused to give me back my clothes until they inspected them and washed them. The entire time there was 3 adults present. I was kept in the detention center for 30 days; I had some mental breakdowns and spent most of the 30 days in solitary confinement. One day the staff informed us we were going to the doctor for an exam. The other inmates told me the doctor is a bad guy, he tries to play with you during a pap test. I asked them how do you get out of going? They said, if you tell him, you have your menstrual happening he won’t do the exam. \n After 30 days, an officer of the detention center took me to appear in family court with a children’s aid representative. They told the judge they had a group home they wanted to place me in, in the country far north of the city, where it would be difficult for me to run away. They said, it was one of the best group homes they had. They just wanted to keep me in the detention center for another 2 weeks, while they get things arranged. The judge told them, he will only approve for me to stay in the detention center for 48hours longer, because I have not committed any crimes. The children’s aid representative came to pick me up the following day and drove me out to a farmhouse, far where I do not know anyone. I arrived at the farmhouse they seemed nice, they had 12 other kids around my age all there with similar issues, I was almost 14 years old now. I was shown my room upstairs, shared with one other kid. The first night, the father of the group home came into our bedroom, he had sex with my roommate, I pretended to stay sleeping. The next day, I asked my roommate what happened last night? why did you not fight him off? They told me they did not mind; it helps to get privileges the other kids don’t get. That evening we were called to dinner, at a long wood table with long benches on both sides and 2 chairs at each end. I was standing in front of the bench, awkward, not sure where to sit, when the father of the home smacked my back side and smiled at me. I looked at him, with the angriest look I could, and I said, in a normal tone but strict voice, DON’T YOU EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN. I stayed in the farmhouse for 2 years, never did the father bother me again. He did continue to come in our bedroom frequently, and have sex with my roommate, but he never bothered me.\n I turned 16, I was taken back to family court by a children’s aid representative, my birth family never came to court. The judge for the first time, spoke to me directly. He told me children’s aid has a program, where you can live in an apartment, with a couple other kids your age. All you must do is go to school and do well. I didn’t even know what grade I had, my education was terribly disrupted, I could not focus on school at all. I asked the judge if I agree to this offer will children’s aid remain my guardians? The judge said yes, and they will check up on you, but not live with you. I told the judge I’m sorry, but the only thing I want is to be free of any guardians, free to figure out my own path. The judge then told me, I will be leaving the court with no support. I said OKAY, I understand. I’m begging you to please just let me go. That was the best day of my life I was granted emancipation. Now I was free from all my abusers. \n I have been wandering around the city ever since. I quickly learned I could not get a job; I had no education and no prior job experience. I felt I had nothing left I could do, and I started SW for money to survive, I ended up pregnant. I went to the doctor to confirm I was pregnant and explain my situation. I’ll be honest I can’t take care of myself leave alone a baby I told her, I cannot carry a child, I want an abortion, I can’t bring a child into this world, I just can’t. She said they needed an ultrasound to see what’s going on, she felt I was further along than 1 month pregnant. The ultrasound report came back, and the doctor called me, she said, I am only 1 month pregnant and pregnant with identical twins. I asked her how she knows they are identical twins? when I am only 1 month pregnant. She said the ultrasound shows 2 babies in the same amniotic sack, if it was fraternal twins they would be in separate amniotic sacks. I told her I needed to think about things, and I would call her back. I decided I could not go through with aborting these babies, reality was setting in. I thought maybe now I was older I could try getting a job.\n I have managed to get a couple of low paying jobs while pregnant, my last one was at a coffee shop. At 7 months pregnant, I went for a walk one evening, my belly was so big, and the babies were kicking and moving quite a bit, I could not get comfortable. Along my walk I could feel them settling down. The next day I could not feel them moving. I called the doctor, and she sent me for an ultrasound the next day. The ultrasound technician said, they would send the results to my doctor, she would not tell me anything. I went to my first prenatal class that night, I had been putting it off, I was alone and felt anxiety about going. The class ended at 10pm and as I was leaving, I saw a message on my phone, it was from my doctor. She wanted me to call her back, did not matter what time I got the message. I called her back, she would not tell me anything, just to come see her the next day. I went to see her the next day, she said, they could not find any heartbeat on the ultrasound. I was in shock, I needed to know what happens next. I have a big belly, where do the babies go now? like, how does this even happen? She said, my body can still go into labor on its own, they were going to wait 2 weeks, if my body did not go into labor, they would induce labor. In shock and crying, I said OKAY, and left. I don’t know how any of this works.\n I waited the 2 weeks with a big belly, with 2 babies dead, not moving, just still. I missed their movements; I did not stop crying for 2 weeks straight. Two weeks later, they induced labor, and I delivered 2 beautiful babies; 1 baby weighed 1lb the other baby weighed 1 ½ pounds. They were both delivered stillbirth. One baby was very dark, and the other baby was very pale, the doctor said, one baby got too much blood and the other baby did not get enough blood, and they both died of heart failure. They had me in an exam room in the basement of the hospital, so i would not be around other people giving birth. They left me for a few moments with the babies, they were beautiful, both had all 5 toes and fingers, and they had a full head of dark hair, both. I will never forget what they looked like, and I never want to. I was released from the hospital, and almost immediately they started calling me, insisting I make funeral arrangements, they cannot keep the babies in the morgue.\n I called several funeral homes, the least expensive was $2000.00. So, I went back to work at the coffee shop, when I went into work, they told me to clean out my locker, I was fired. I’m really trying, but I am alone, I do not have family or anyone I can go to for help. I have been experiencing manic episodes while trying to deal with everything happening to me. When I was in the detention center, I was seen by a psychiatrist. They diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder and PTSD. I also was diagnosed with visual processing disorder, which is a form of dyslexia. This makes it hard for me to learn, I need a special tutor to get my education. I am trying to make it in this unfair world, but lately it’s been very stressful, and stress aggravates my mental illness. I tried to get help at a church and was turned away because I’m NOT a woman. I’m nonbinary. It’s hard enough to not get support irl. I pleaded with everyone here on Tumblr to please help me, and everyone that Re blogged and donated helped to make that happen. I want everyone to know I was able to collect my baby’s ashes, by showing good and paying half the money $1000.00 that I was able to gather from all the donations. I still must pay the remainder, but I have time and I can do that once I secure employment again. I have also filed the paperwork for disability benefits, but the waiting period is 6 months to a year, so a job is probably going to happen before disability decides if I qualify for assistance. I am so grateful for all the support everyone here on Tumblr gave me, Ya’ll are the Best! Thank You! You know who you are and I’m forever grateful!\n GOAL WAS REACHED!\n  I am not asking for reblogs of this post. But, if you want to share my story because you think it should be shared, please feel free to do so. I am okay with that. Maybe it can help someone else. ", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/anapurpledinosaur/704981456806625280/this-is-my-life-story-this-post-is-long-and-not"}

The shape Jason Momoa is in during his movies is achieved by a diet designed to lower his body fat to unhealthy numbers, dehydrating him and enhancing his abs with make up. This is what ripped, muscular, healthy person looks like on their off time. If you think this is a dad bod, for the love of everything that is holy, shut up and absolutely never comment on a man’s body ever again. I mean hell, you can still see his damn v-line, what fucking dad bod has that?!\n Don’t believe me? Google some bodybuilders who are off their contest diet. The men who literally make a living for having defined muscles. For 360 days a year, they do not look like the way you think they do. During a bodybuilding contest, these men’s body fat is under 7%, they’re dehydeated and covered in fake tan that helps the muscles show up. And it’s literally only for that day, because it’s extremely unhealthy. Same goes for actors who are known for being ripped - they’re at their worst when they’re filming. This exact same shit happened with Vin Diesel few years ago with people getting a paparazzi shot of his “beer belly” and I’m genuinely worried of the young men who grow up in this society thinking being muscular means having defined abs 24/7.\n Jason Momoa looks ripped and healthy, yall are just blind with unrealistic standards.\n “This is what actors (& models & bodybuilders) do. If you see them with razor cut abs, they have been on a low carb, water-reducing diet to get there. You cannot retain that and be healthy.  When we shot WOLVES, Jason asked me, “Do I have to have abs n’ shit for this?”  I said no.”  \n -   \n David Hayter\n , director, \n Wolves\n “The wood chopping scene in The Wolverine was all the footage they could get before Hugh Jackman passed out from dehydration. Dehydration and steroids are the big secret behind Hollywood muscle definition.”\n -   \n My name is Grant‏\n    \n “Yeah there was a huge piece a few years ago about the prevalence of doping in the aftermath of Dark Knight (roughly), it became an arms race of every male actor going on roids for definition. Compare Jackman in XMen 1 from 2000 to him in Logan, for example.”\n -   \n Kuff ‘n’ Klout\n    \n “The Hollywood roid phenomenon in one picture”\n -   \n Kuff ‘n’ Klout‏ \n    \n “The Guest” movie - \n I like how they call starvation and dehydration a “trick” :)))))))))\n I KNOW.

Touching isn’t for everyone. \n  Do not say upsetting things like “where is my hug?” Clown, you don’t own hugs. \n  It is fine to model consent by placing boundaries on touch. “Let’s wash your hands before we cuddle.” “I’m leaving this couch if you continue to yeet your foot into my pregnant belly.” “that was fun but I’m going to take a break now.”  \n  Touchy children are not inherently sweeter. Love languages exist at any age.\n  Some kids like touch but not eye contact. A hug from behind is a good one or “let’s close our eyes and squeeze really tight. Ready?” \n  I’m dead f*ing serious there are people who want your physical affection so badly but need you to modify your approach.

They struck up a conversation with me and told me how amazing it was to see an openly transexual youth such as myself. I asked them about their experiences with gender and they said “oh, well, I’m a bit male and a bit female. Men’s and women’s clothes, sometimes makeup in a suit, sometime fresh faced in a dress when I’m at home. You know, bisexual” Obv this puzzled me at first until I realized this person was using bisexual in a very, very, literal and old fashioned sense, as in, dual-sexed. Non-binary.  \n Y’all gotta understand there are generation gaps in the language we use and you open yourself up to a LOT of very interesting stories if you stop blocking off the past.\n One of the biggest problems with modern community is the idea that (white) western, post 2000s LGBT vocabulary is the only correct way to speak about sexuality and gender. \n Like the freak outs under pictures of protests from the 70s-90s because signs and shirts say faggot and dyke and queer, as if these words weren’t a key part of identity and activism. \n Beyond just English, I saw a couple people making fun of the term “gender x” in an anime…but why would a Japanese production adhere to English standards?\n Or the way people talk about pronouns as if every language uses pronouns the same way as English. \n It’s just…it indicates a mindset that these words are objective and written in stone and western youth culture is always the most correct in a way that…feels icky.

You won't feel that way after some time\n -> cut off sensitive topics.\n  Stop checking on the news if it feels too much. Mute or unfollow those who post triggering content. Tell your friends and family members that you don't want to talk about certain topics. It's okay to distant yourself not only from the news but from people/topics you find toxic.\n -> rely on safe content instead.\n  Re-read your favorite book or re-watch a show that makes you feel better. Use messengers instead of socials to contact your close ones.\n -> sleep.\n  Sleep washes off emotions and can calm you down, and recharge you.\n -> invest your time in a hobby. \n Shift your focus a little. Hobbies that involve physical and/or sensual activity work even better. These can be painting, knitting, gardening, dancing, or singing. \n -> go outside. \n Walk your dog or jog a little. Make your body move and breathe fresh air. Connect with your surroundings, visit your local park or forest. \n -> realize what you can do at the very moment to support yourself and your close ones.

Women rarely have the same dramatic symptoms that men have… you know, the sudden stabbing pain in the chest, the cold sweat, grabbing the chest & dropping to the floor the we see in movies. Here is the story of one woman’s experience with a heart attack: \n  \"I had a heart attack at about 10:30 PM with NO prior exertion, NO prior emotional trauma that one would suspect might have brought it on. I was sitting all snugly & warm on a cold evening, with my purring cat in my lap, reading an interesting story my friend had sent me, and actually thinking, ‘A-A-h, this is the life, all cozy and warm in my soft, cushy Lazy Boy with my feet propped up. A moment later, I felt that awful sensation of indigestion, when you’ve been in a hurry and grabbed a bite of sandwich and washed it down with a dash of water, and that hurried bite seems to feel like you’ve swallowed a golf ball going down the esophagus in slow motion and it is most uncomfortable. You realize you shouldn’t have gulped it down so fast and needed to chew it more thoroughly and this time drink a glass of water to hasten its progress down to the stomach. This was my initial sensation–the only trouble was that I hadn’t taken a bite of anything since about 5:00 p.m. \n After it seemed to subside, the next sensation was like little squeezing motions that seemed to be racing up my SPINE (hind-sight, it was probably my aorta spasms), gaining speed as they continued racing up and under my sternum (breast bone, where one presses rhythmically when administering CPR). This fascinating process continued on into my throat and branched out into both jaws. ‘AHA!! NOW I stopped puzzling about what was happening – we all have read and/or heard about pain in the jaws being one of the signals of an MI happening, haven’t we? I said aloud to myself and the cat, Dear God, I think I’m having a heart attack! I lowered the foot rest dumping the cat from my lap, started to take a step and fell on the floor instead. I thought to myself, If this is a heart attack, I shouldn’t be walking into the next room where the phone is or anywhere else… but, on the other hand, if I don’t, nobody will know that I need help, and if I wait any longer I may not be able to get up in a moment. \n I pulled myself up with the arms of the chair, walked slowly into the next room and dialed the Paramedics… I told her I thought I was having a heart attack due to the pressure building under the sternum and radiating into my jaws. I didn’t feel hysterical or afraid, just stating the facts. She said she was sending the Paramedics over immediately, asked if the front door was near to me, and if so, to un-bolt the door and then lie down on the floor where they could see me when they came in. I unlocked the door and then laid down on the floor as instructed and lost consciousness, as I don’t remember the medics coming in, their examination, lifting me onto a gurney or getting me into their ambulance, or hearing the call they made to St. Jude ER on the way, but I did briefly awaken when we arrived and saw that the radiologist was already there in his surgical blues and cap, helping the medics pull my stretcher out of the ambulance. He was bending over me asking questions (probably something like ‘Have you taken any medications?’) but I couldn’t make my mind interpret what he was saying, or form an answer, and nodded off again, not waking up until the Cardiologist and partner had already threaded the teeny angiogram balloon up my femoral artery into the aorta and into my heart where they installed 2 side by side stints to hold open my right coronary artery. \n I know it sounds like all my thinking and actions at home must have taken at least 20-30 minutes before calling the paramedics, but actually it took perhaps 4-5 minutes before the call, and both the fire station and St Jude are only minutes away from my home, and my Cardiologist was already to go to the OR in his scrubs and get going on restarting my heart (which had stopped somewhere between my arrival and the procedure) and installing the stents. Why have I written all of this to you with so much detail? Because I want all of you who are so important in my life to know what I learned first hand. \n 1. Be aware that something very different is happening in your body, not the usual men’s symptoms but inexplicable things happening (until my sternum and jaws got into the act). It is said that many more women than men die of their first (and last) MI because they didn’t know they were having one and commonly mistake it as indigestion, take some Maalox or other anti-heartburn preparation and go to bed, hoping they’ll feel better in the morning when they wake up… which doesn’t happen. My female friends, your symptoms might not be exactly like mine, so I advise you to call the Paramedics if ANYTHING is unpleasantly happening that you’ve not felt before. It is better to have a ‘false alarm’ visitation than to risk your life guessing what it might be! \n2. Note that I said ‘Call the Paramedics.’ And if you can take an aspirin. Ladies, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE! Do NOT try to drive yourself to the ER - you are a hazard to others on the road. Do NOT have your panicked husband who will be speeding and looking anxiously at what’s happening with you instead of the road. Do NOT call your doctor – he doesn’t know where you live and if it’s at night you won’t reach him anyway, and if it’s daytime, his assistants (or answering service) will tell you to call the Paramedics. He doesn’t carry the equipment in his car that you need to be saved! The Paramedics do, principally OXYGEN that you need ASAP. Your Dr. will be notified later. \n3. Don’t assume it couldn’t be a heart attack because you have a normal cholesterol count. Research has discovered that a cholesterol elevated reading is rarely the cause of an MI (unless it’s unbelievably high and/or accompanied by high blood pressure). MIs are usually caused by long-term stress and inflammation in the body, which dumps all sorts of deadly hormones into your system to sludge things up in there. Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep. Let’s be careful and be aware. The more we know the better chance we could survive to tell the tale.“ \n Reblog, repost, Facebook, tweet, pin, email, morse code, fucking carrier pigeon this to save a life! \n\nI wish I knew who the author was. I’m definitely not the OP, actually think it might be an old chain email or even letter from back in the day. The version I saw floating around Facebook ended with “my cardiologist says mail this to 10 friends, maybe you’ll save one!” And knew this was way too interesting not to pass on.\n snopes.com says this one’s true\n .\n Save a life–Reblog.\n Female heart attacks are much different, and most people don’t know it!\n This is so much more helpful than the fucking lists that basically describe everything that happens during a really nasty panic attack and then tell you to go seek help as if you don’t have an anxiety disorder that does this to you on a regular basis and can afford to go to the emergency room.\n Auto-reblog.\n Many women have silent heart attacks as well, where there are no symptoms at all until BAM! Then it happens.\n As a formerly (mostly) healthy person who is now dealing with post-covid heart issues, this was tremendously helpful to read. Reblog, save a life.\n Important for all genders so you can recognize other symptoms in yourself and others.

{"user_name": ["anapurpledinosaur", "jaydhon"], "user_comment": "\"Depression is humiliating. It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your children, your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything outside of bed. You alienate your friends because you can’t comport yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation.\n If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life.\n It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. If you and your loved ones have been spared, every blessing to you. If depression has taken root in you or your loved ones, every blessing to you, too. No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a dentist appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself.\n Depression is real. Just because you’ve never had it doesn’t make it imaginary. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression.

The first is that the seal is shoving its head in holes in the rocks and the eel panics and goes for what looks like a hole—ie a seal nostril. And that would be a great theory, except that seals have what are described as “extremely muscular nostrils” because they gotta slam them closed when diving to keep water out.\n Which, okay, fine, except that there’s often like two, three feet of eel INSIDE THE SEAL. The stuff hanging out is just the end of the tail. And eels are astonishingly powerful for their size, true, but so are seal nostrils. (Why am I typing these words? How did my life come to this?)\n The other theory, of course, is that they barfed up an eel and it came out their nose instead, but we’re talking a fairly impressive feat that the eel lined up just right to come out the nostrils, and also those are BIG eels. It’d be kinda like a human puking a spear of asparagus out of their nose. (Why am I typing THESE words, too? Why?)\n The remaining theory, which is actually the one ascribed to by the lead scientist on the endangered monk seal project, is that dumb teenage seals are snorting eels at each other for fun. And y’know…I just…sure. We live in a world where that wouldn’t even be the tenth strangest thing I’ve heard about mammals.\n In conclusion, if any young monk seals are following me, Just Say No To Eel.\n EXACTLY LIKE THAT probably\n Ok but the real question is what happens to the eels? Are they alive up there squiggling around like, ‘wtf?’ Do the scientists remove them? Are eels beginning to avoid areas where teenage monk seals hang out? \n I regret to say that the eels do not come out of this as well as the seals do. But it did lead to one of the most understated and marvelous sentences ever spoken by a wildlife rehabber, namely: \n “Though no seals have died or been seriously affected by the eels, having a dead animal up their noses for any extended amount of time poses potentially adverse health impacts, said Simeone, director of Ke Kai Ola, a monk seal hospital in Hawaii run by the Marine Mammal Center.”\n So I guess by now the seals know if they snort an eel, they get to go to an all expenses paid vacation in the seal hospital, and just hang out and get fed and meet other cute young seals?", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/anapurpledinosaur/704287083498438656/runcibility-socialpants-tkingfisher"}

And with the rise of right wing politics in parts of the western world it is important to talk about the victims of the Holocaust.\n These are called Stolpersteine (stumbling stones)\n  because while you go about your day to day life you literally \"stumble\" across these. These stones are on the ground, where everyone walks, in the middle of hundreds of cities all over Germany and a few neighboring countries.\n They are in front of the last residencies of victims of the Holocaust. Every single stone is dedicated to one person. They always say \"here lived -name-\" then their birthday and what we know about what happened to them.\n For example this one says:\n \"Here lived\n Georg Rosenberg\n Year 1886 (which is the year he was born in, the exact birthday isn't known)\n Arrested 1939\n Deported 1943\n Murdered in Auschwitz\"\n These are there so that we will never forget what happened and that even when you're doing mundane chores you might stumble across these and remember the victims. This is especially important now that the last survivors, who can tell their stories first hand, are dying.\n Every year people get together to clean the Stolpersteine, so that they stay intact and readable.\n Remembering and being reminded of the horrible things that happened and remembering the victims is one of the most important parts in preventing something like this from happening again.\n So if you ever come to Germany or if you actually live here and have never noticed these, maybe take some time to look down and read about these people's fates\n Today marks 77 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, so I thought I would reblog this again, because I think it's important.\n Are there plans to protect these stones, from the elements or people? I feel like over time they'll be harder to read.\n Every year on Holocaust remembrance day people go out and polish the stones. So most of them stay readable for a long time. If they get too damaged or unreadable they are replaced\n Also, if you know about a person not yet remembered by such a stone you can also write the non-profit organization that organizes the making of the new stones etc. And if you want you can become \"godfather\" to one of the stones and care for it preservation. \n According to Wikipedia the Stolpersteine are also in 29 other European countries. \n For more infos", "comment_url": "https://www.tumblr.com/anapurpledinosaur/704205427960856576"}
